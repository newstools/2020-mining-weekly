The Assembly of First Nations Quebec-Labrador (AFNQL) has questioned the Quebec government’s decision to allow mining to resume, arguing that the “hasty resumption” could compromise the efforts made by communities to slow the spread of Covid-19. “The movement and comings and goings (fly-in, fly-out) of mining workers is of great concern,” AFNQL chief Ghislain Picard said on Wednesday. The AFNQL stressed the vulnerability of the communities and said that First Nations experts were unanimous on the fact that deconfinement would have to be extended over a longer period, for several reasons, including the lack of confinement sites. AFNQL also expressed concern about how the message could be perceived by the population: Resuming activities must not mean a loosening of preventive measures.
