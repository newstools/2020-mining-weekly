PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Dual-listed Champion Iron told shareholders on Friday that the company would start ramping up operations at its Bloom Lake mining complex, in Quebec, after the provincial government declared mining to be a "priority service". The announcement meant that the ASX- and TSX-listed company would be allowed to resume normal operations, conditional on the implementation of guidelines aimed at containing the risks related to the Covid-19 pandemic. Champion Iron in March this year was forced to ramp down operations at Bloom Lake as part of a province down initiative to contain the spread of the virus. “Being recognised as a priority service comes with great responsibilities. Although we aim to ramp up operations, our focus remains on protecting everyone’s health and safety,” said CEO David Cataford. “I am thankful for the support we have received from the local communities, our partners and our union in response to the unprecedented challenges related to the Covid-19 pandemic, including their rapid adoption of new measures required by the company and the government in order to ramp up operations.”
