PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Fertoz has inked a letter of intent and supply agreement with US-based PhoSul, a subsidiary of diversified commercial fertilizer provider Propeat. Under the agreement, Fertoz would supply rock phosphate for use in PhoSul for a patented fertilizer blend of phosphate and speciality sulfurs. The two companies are targeting 1 000 t of sales in the first year of the agreement, which will run year-to-year and renew automatically. “We are excited about this partnership. We have signed a detailed letter of intent and are finalising our joint venture to cooperate at all levels, commercial products through Propeat, organic products in the PhoSul line, and also manufacturing, trucking, warehousing and development of new products,” said Fertoz VP of sales for Western North America, Derek Squair. “This agreement will support our existing work with some major producers of organic and sulphur products to broaden our product lines and increase volumes. While we have worked with the Pocock companies for some time, we think this joint venture will strengthen all areas.”
