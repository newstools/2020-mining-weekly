PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The Czech Ministry of the Environment has granted a preliminary mining permit for the northwestern part of the Cinovec deposit, ASX-listed European Metals said. The permit, which has been issued for a period of eight years, is a necessary legal prequalification before obtaining a final mining permit, and guarantees the company the priority right to apply for and obtain a final mining area and final mining permit. The preliminary approval for the northwestern part of the deposit covers an area of 1.27 km2 and, along with the existing preliminary mining permits, now encompasses the entire Cinovec ore reserve. “With 100% of the Cinovec ore reserve now covered, Geomet is now the sole company that can apply for a final mining permit across the Cinovec ore reserve, which is Europe’s largest hard rock lithium reserve and a globally significant deposit,” said European Metals MD Keith Coughlan. “With the recent investment of €29.1-million into Geomet by CEZ, this security tenure now allows Geomet to focus on rapidly advancing the feasibility and permitting of Cinovec.” Geomet is 49% owned by European Metals and 51% by CEZ.
