Copper/gold miner First Quantum still has about 800 people in preventative quarantine at the Cobre Panama mine, which was closed early this month following several positive cases of Covid-19 and the subsequent death of a worker. Of the more than 7 000 people working at the Cobre Panama mine, about 2 000 remained inside the mining complex when operations closed down and have been progressively transferred. Of those, about 700 are already at home and  500 are quarantined in hotels in the region. The final step will be to transfer the 800 people still at Cobre Panama, when they finish their Healthy Ministry-imposed preventative isolation period, the company says. Cobre Panama is increasing prevention measures and protocols for those in quarantine. Country manager for Cobre Panama, Keith Green, says in a statement that it believes the protocols implemented at the mine are yielding good results.
