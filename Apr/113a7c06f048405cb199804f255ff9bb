TSX-listed Wallbridge Mining said on Thursday that its exploration activities, originally expected to be suspended until April 15, would not resume until at least May 4, in line with the latest Covid-19 plans of Ontario and Quebec. The company is exploring the Fenelon gold project, in the Abitibi greenstone belt, Quebec, and has operations in Ontario. Wallbridge also withdrew its full-year 2020 exploration drilling guidance of 100 000 m to 120 000 m to assess Covid-19's impact. “Our drill contractors remain prepared to continue drilling with six surface drill rigs as soon as site activities can be resumed.” Workers impacted by the suspension of activities would receive their base wages until May 4. Results of the 26 000 m of drilling completed so far in 2020 should be received within the next four to six weeks.
