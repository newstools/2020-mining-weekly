London-listed Bluejay Mining is expanding its Greenland presence with two new exploration licences in the south of the country. The licences cover a total of 2 025 km2 near the southern tip of Greenland. The licences, to be known as the Thunderstone project, are prospective for base metals, especially zinc, with additional significant potential for large-scale gold and uranium occurrences. Bluejay CEO Roderick McIllree noted that, since its application for Thunderstone, there had been an explosion in licence applications in south Greenland, with a further 6 240 km2 now under application by other exploration companies. “. . . . it is not only Bluejay that considers this region to be highly prospective.” He noted that Bluejay was already familiar with this region and that its technical team had several decades of combined expertise in the geology of south Greenland. “This is supported by our recent re-analysis of all available historic stream sediment samples by modern analytical techniques. As a consequence, we are excited by the potential for significant new discoveries in this mineral region of Greenland, which will be supported by the construction of a new international airport in south Greenland currently under way.” The licences will hold no financial commitments for Bluejay, in line with the government’s recent adjustment of mineral exploration obligations for 2020 for all exclusive exploration licences to zero, regardless of licence age, in response to the Covid-19 pandemic.
