PERTH (miningweekly.com) – New data by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) has pointed out that Australia’s merchandise exports rose A$8-billion, or 29%, during March, with a significant rise reported in the resources export sector. The value of goods exports reached A$36.1-billion in March. The ABS noted that key movers in the sector were the export of iron-ore to China, Australia’s largest trading partner, which increased significantly following declines in January and February. There were also large increases in the value of exports of coal, gas and petroleum, and strong exports of non-monetary gold, particularly to Hong Kong and the UK, the ABS reported. The Minerals Council of Australia (MCA) on Friday said that the result highlighted the importance of keeping Australia’s mining industry operating during the Covid-19 pandemic and related economic challenges. “Australia’s mining industry has been able to deliver this result for the nation while implementing strict and comprehensive health and safety protocols to protect workers, families and local communities,” said MCA CEO Tania Constable. “Keeping mining open for business during this challenging time not only protects 1.1-million jobs – it enables the industry to keep paying taxes and royalties which help fund government assistance programmes for workers and small businesses affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.”
