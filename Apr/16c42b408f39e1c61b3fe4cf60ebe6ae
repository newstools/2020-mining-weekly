The company’s latest tax report noted that Rio made a $45.1-billion direct economic contribution in 2019 to the countries and communities where it operates, taking the company’s direct economic contribution since 2015 to $210-billion. “Our business, including the taxes and royalties we pay, plays a critical role in the overall economic health and development of the regions where we operate,” said CFO Jakob Stausholm. “The funds we provide to governments and communities support the basic infrastructure of society – bridges and roads, schools and hospitals – as well as other local development priorities, like job creation and skills training. Being transparent about where these payments go helps our stakeholders better understand how these funds may be used.”
