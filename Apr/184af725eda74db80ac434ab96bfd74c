Trilogy Metals, which has a 50:50 joint venture (JV) with global major South32 in Alaska, on Monday announced the appointment of Tony Giardini as president and CEO with effect from June 1. Giardini has been a director of Trilogy since 2012, when it was spun out of Novagold Resources as a public company. He was recently president of base metals developer Ivanhoe Mines and was formerly also CFO of senior miner Kinross Gold. Trilogy pointed out that Giardini had extensive experience with JVs and large capital projects, including Ivanhoe's three large development assets, Platreef, Kipushi and Kamoa-Kakula, in Africa. Trilogy chairperson Janice Stairs commented that Giardini was appointed following an “extensive global search”. Jim Gowans would continue in his role as interim president and CEO until May 31. Gowans remains in his role as a director of the company and he will continue as a member of the board of Ambler Metals, overseeing the company's interests in its JV with South32. Ambler, in which Trilogy holds 50%, owns the UKMP project, in north-western Alaska. South32 in December exercised its option to acquire a 50% JV interest in Ambler.
