Dual-listed Tanzanian Gold reports that SGS Canada Lakefield will soon start comprehensive metallurgical testing on the primary or sulphide gold mineralisation at the Buckreef gold project, in northern Tanzania. The results will be the basis for a final feasibility study. The company believes data points to a potential tripling of the sulphide plant's capacity to produce 150 000 oz/y to 175 000 oz/y of gold. “Today’s announcement that one of the world’s premier metallurgical facilities will be confirming a new flowsheet is a direct result of our prior announcement that the company has more than doubled its mineral resources. "With the addition of the new sulphide plant, the Buckreef project could have two ore treatment plants producing at the same time,” Tanzanian Gold executive chairperson James Sinclair states.
