The government of New Brunswick has placed all mineral claims under protection status to ensure continuity of mineral claims amid uncertainty brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic. The Canadian province announced last week that work requirements for the 2020 field season would be waived and that all active claims would be extended for one year. The extensions would be completed by Department of Natural Resources and Energy Development staff in the coming weeks, but until that time, all claims would be placed under ‘protection’ status. Claims that expire between April 1 and December 31 would not be subject to renewal fees when extended for the one-year period and any claims that were renewed prior to the March 16 closure of government offices would also receive a one-year extension. TSX-V-listed X-Terra Resources president and CEO Michael Ferreira praised the New Brunswick government’s announcement. "This is a bold step and demonstrates the outstanding leadership and support the government has taken to ensure stability for individuals and companies like X-Terra Resources, that have been working and will continue exploring in the province, once the Covid-19 pandemic situation begins to improve,” said Ferreira. In other news, X-Terra Resources has received the results from the first two holes of 13 holes drilled over the Grog property. Anomalous gold and silver results, including one value of 15.7 g/t gold and 0.19 g/t silver over 1 m, were obtained from the first two targets. Results from the 11 remaining holes have yet to be received and X-Terra explained that the delay in the results was owing to the closure of the lab.
