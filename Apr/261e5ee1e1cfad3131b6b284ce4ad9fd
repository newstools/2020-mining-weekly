Aim-listed Goldplat will restart its South Africans operations on a reduced basis by April 20. Mineral Resources and Energy Minister Gwede Mantashe on April 16 announced that South African mining operations will be allowed to resume at a 50% operating capacity from April 17. Measures have been taken to enable employees to operate in a hygienic environment, including employees being screened and cleared for work, Goldplat says. The operations will comply with the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy'sÂ request to ensure the health and safety of employees during the lockdown period. Goldplats operations in Ghana, South Africa and in Kenya, continue to be affected by government restrictions and protocols in response to the global Covid-19 pandemic. Although in certain large cities in Ghana lockdown has been imposed, the mining sector has been classified as essential by the Ghanaian government and the company's operation in Ghana is still continuing at almost normal levels. Goldplat's Kilimapesa gold plant, in Kenya, together with the mine, remains under care and maintenance.
