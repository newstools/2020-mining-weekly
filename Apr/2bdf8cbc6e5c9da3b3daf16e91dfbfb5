Aim-listed gold project developer Kodal Minerals has received renewals on its exploration licences for the Dabakala and Korhogo concessions, in Côte d’Ivoire, for a further three years to April 2023. The company is, however, still awaiting an exploration licence renewal for its Boundiali project, as well as renewals for the Tiebissou, Nielle and M’Bahaikro projects, which the company owns jointly with ASX- and LSE-listed Resolute Mining, in Côte d’Ivoire. Kodal and Resolute plan to start exploration drilling on the Nielle project soon to follow up on mineralisation that was defined by prior drilling. However, owing to the outbreak of Covid-19, exploration activity in the country has been postponed and will only start closer to the end of the year, following the wet season. Kodal also maintains gold exploration concessions in Mali.
