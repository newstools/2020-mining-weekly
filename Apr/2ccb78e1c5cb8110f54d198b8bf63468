Diversified gold producer Nordgold Group has signed an engineering, procurement and construction agreement with Chinese manufacturing service group SUMEC, a key member of China National Machinery Industry Corporation, to design and build a 33 MW power plant at its Lefa mine – one of the largest gold mines in Guinea. The new heavy fuel oil (HFO) power plant will replace the existing facility and reduce both fuel consumption for electricity production by 15% and engine oil by 30%. This will result in a 17 000 t/y reduction of greenhouse-gas emissions, which is in line with Nordgold’s climate change objectives, as well as its commitments to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.
