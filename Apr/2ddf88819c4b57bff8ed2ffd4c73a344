PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Gold miner Resolute Mining has committed more than $1-million in funding to support the response efforts from its host nations in Africa against the Covid-19 pandemic. The ASX-listed miner said that its commitment would consist of direct financial assistance as well as sourcing and supply of vitally important personal protective equipment, Covid-19 testing kits and other medical equipment. “Extraordinary events require an extraordinary response. Resolute is proud to assist Mali and Senegal in the fight against Covid-19. The challenges represented by Covid-19 continue to change daily and we must remain agile and united in our response to the pandemic,” said Resolute MD and CEO John Welborn. He noted that the contributions to the special Covid-19 funds set up by the Mali and Senegalese governments built on Resolute’s ongoing contribution of medical services and supplies to the communities around the Syama gold mine and the Mako gold mine.
