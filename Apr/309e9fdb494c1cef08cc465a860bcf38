Financial services provider Ubank, together with the Mineworkers Investment Company (MIC), have joined forces to support government to combat the negative financial impacts of Covid-19 by contributing R2-million towards relief efforts. Of this, R1-million will comprise Ubank’s contribution towards the Solidarity Fund and the remaining R1-million will be dedicated to supporting current and former mineworkers and their families who are negatively impacted by current circumstances. Ubank has a large beneficiary base within the platinum and gold mining sectors. The R1-million dedicated to supporting the current and former mineworkers and their families will be in the form of food parcels. Ubank will work with its partners, the MIC and the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) to ensure the funds support as many families as possible. The contribution will benefit the needy families from areas where the mineworkers reside or come from, as well as the poorest families from the labour-intensive areas. Ubank chairperson Keshan Pillay says MIC recognises the hardship the disease will bring to its beneficiary base as an organisation with deep roots in the mining sector. Through the Mineworkers Development Agency, MIC CEO Mary Bomela says MIC will ensure the collective contribution is effectively administered to ensure it does its part to relieve food shortages for mineworkers, their families and surrounding communities. “It is commendable to us as the NUM that our people, our members are not forgotten during this time of hardship. The alliance between Ubank and the MIC is saluted as it is directed at the most vulnerable,” says NUM general secretary David Sipunzi. “Food parcels are the most effective route as this will help reduce unnecessary movement of our people and as such it will help mineworkers and their communities to abide by the lockdown protocols,” concludes Pillay.
