PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Gold miner Blackham Resources has reported a soft March quarter, with production falling from 20 003 oz in the December quarter to 12 950 oz. The ASX-listed company said that production in the March quarter was impacted by seasonal weather, equipment issues and shortages of qualified operators, which led to limited access of high-grade ore. All-in sustaining costs for the quarter also increased, from A$1 527/oz to A$2 287/oz. Gold sales for the quarter were also down from 20 453 oz to 12 635 oz, which was partially offset by an increase in the achieved gold price, which was reported at A$2 267/oz, up from the A$2 072/oz reported in the previous quarter. Blackham has previously warned that gold production for the full year would likely be at the lower end of the guidance of between 70 000 oz and 80 000 oz. Meanwhile, Blackham on Friday said that owing to Covid-19 issues, particularly regarding access to site for contractors, the planned construction of the concentrator of its Stage 1 sulphide expansion project, has been delayed by some six months. The company said that the delay would allow for increased reserves and aid in accelerating new underground mine development. The Stage 1 sulphide expansion project at Blackham’s Western Australian operations will increase the production rate to between 100 000 oz and 120 000 oz a year. The Stage 1 production rates are expected to average some 110 000 oz/y from 2022 to 2027, and will underpin Blackham’s pathway to a more than 200 000 oz/y producer following a Stage 2 expansion.
