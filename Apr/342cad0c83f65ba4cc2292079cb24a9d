JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) – Metals processing company Jubilee Metals announced on Friday that its South African operations had recommenced and it was strictly adhering to the updated lockdown regulations set out to combat the Covid-19 pandemic. Jubilee retreats mine tailings, waste, slag, slurry and other secondary materials generated from mining operations.

Staff at both operations had been reduced to include only critical personnel needed to maintain continuous operations. Strict health and security measures had been enforced to ensure that employees were adequately protected, while close liaison with the South African authorities was continuing. The London Aim- and Johannesburg  AltX-traded company said the situation regarding its other chrome operations still on hold was being reviewed and updates would follow.
