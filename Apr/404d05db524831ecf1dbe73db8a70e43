Aim-listed diamond producer BlueRock Diamonds, which owns the Kareevlei mine, in Kimberley, in the Northern Cape, says the two-week extension of South Africa's national lockdown to April 30 will not have a significant impact on its strategy. Executive chairperson Mike Houston says the lockdown extension did not come as a surprise and is consistent with what is happening around the world. “The extension has no direct impact on our strategy and we continue to ensure that we reduce costs whilst we are in care and maintenance and to explore alternative ways to commercialise our product so that we are best placed to fire up production as soon as we are able to.”
