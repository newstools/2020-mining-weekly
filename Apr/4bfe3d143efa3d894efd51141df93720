TSX- and NYSE-listed Teck Resources has created a C$20-million Covid-19 fund to provide direct support to critical services in communities in which it operates. This funding will go to support critical social initiatives and increased healthcare capacity, including procuring one-million masks to be donated for healthcare in British Columbia. “The global health crisis posed by Covid-19 is unlike anything previously faced by companies, by families, and by communities. The scope and severity of this pandemic requires all of us to step up and do our part,” said president and CEO Don Lindsay. Besides the one-million KN95 masks for the province’s healthcare system, the donations also include a dedicated community investment fund in Canada, Alaska and Chile, supporting healthcare services in the Tarapaca and Coquimbo regions of Chile, investments in use of copper towards infection prevention initiatives, contributions to Canadian relief efforts, support for international relief efforts and support for medical research programmes in Canada.
