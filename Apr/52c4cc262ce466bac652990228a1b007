PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Hastings Technology Metals has been granted a commonwealth environmental permit for its Yangibana rare earths project, in Western Australia. “We have now received all material approvals required for the development of the Yangibana rare earths project. This environmental permit complements the state approval received in August 2019,” said Hastings executive chairperson Charles Lew. “Both approvals demonstrate confidence by state and commonwealth governments that the project can be implemented in an environmentally sound manner.” The one-million-tonne-a-year Yangibana operation is expected to produce some 15 000 t/y of mixed rare earths carbonate, and about 8 850 t/y of total rare-earth oxides, with Hastings expected to spend some A$517-million to bring the project on line. Hastings on Monday said that the immediate focus of the company is the continuing improvement of the project’s economics through the progression of a number of mining, metallurgical and process design and research initiatives to expand on studies already completed as part of the definitive feasibility study.
