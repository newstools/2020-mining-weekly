LSE-listed Gem Diamonds’ second round of the flexible tender sales process has been concluded and raised a further $6.7-million for a selection of  large, high-quality diamonds recovered at its Letšeng mine, in Lesotho. The company achieved an average value of $1 615 /ct for the first quarter of 2020. The flexible tender sales process was put in place as a result of the March large diamond tender being cancelled owing to the travel and other Covid-19 restrictions imposed by the Belgian government and the governments of the company's clients. The flexible tender sales process will continue during the period of these restrictions.
