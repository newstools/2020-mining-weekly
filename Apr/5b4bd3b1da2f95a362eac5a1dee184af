JSE-listed coal miner Wescoal will make use of the two-month extension period afforded to listed companies for reporting on their results for the year-ends to December 31, 2019; and January 31, February 29 and March 31, this year. Wescoal motivates that while every effort is being made to ensure business continuity, the controls and protocols that have been implemented to ensure the health of staff are likely to have a pervasive impact on the company, particularly relating to its financial reporting timelines. Given that the companyâ€™s financial year-end is March 31, Wescoal will issue its provisional yearly financial statements and integrated report by no later than August 31 and September 30, respectively.
