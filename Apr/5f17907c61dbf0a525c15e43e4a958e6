The Tshipi é Ntle Manganese Mining company is donating R5-million to the Solidarity Fund set up by President Cyril Ramaphosa in response to the devastating effects of Covid-19. Tshipi é Ntle Manganese Mining chairperson Saki Macozoma says the pandemic has had a considerable impact on all sectors of society, including mining. “Tshipi recognises with appreciation the leadership provided by the Mineral Resources and Energy Minister Gwede Mantashe to the mining industry as we all navigate the challenges that Covid-19 has created.” He hopes the donation can, in some way, help South Africa emerge from this period stronger and more focused on rebuilding its economy and society. The company’s Tshipi Borwa manganese mine, in the Northern Cape, is a significant manganese exporter in Africa, with the mine having exported 3.4-million tonnes of manganese in its last financial year.
