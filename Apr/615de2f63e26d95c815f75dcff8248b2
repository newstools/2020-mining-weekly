A member of Impala Platinum’s Las des Iles (LDI) mine, in Ontario, Canada has died due to complications from Covid-19. The Thunder Bay resident passed away late last week. “This terrible sadness weighs heavily on all of us at LDI, as it does for people across the entire Thunder Bay region. As we navigate the days ahead, we are once again reminded of the seriousness of this global pandemic,” says Impala Canada VP for corporate affairs and communications Erin Satterthwaite. The mine has 25 confirmed cases of Covid-19, of which 13 are considered resolved – meaning 14 days have passed since the onset of symptoms. The Ontario provincial government classified mining an essential service during its state of emergency, which allowed Impala to continue operations at the LDI mine. However, the mine was placed on care-and-maintenance on April 13, after workers tested positive for Covid-19. The majority of LDI’s employees went into self-quarantine until April 27. The mine remains closed and will not reopen until it is safe to do so, Satterhwaite states. On Monday, Impala Canada conducted a shift change to rotate the care-and-maintenance crew. The replacement crew consists of individuals with personal, family and community circumstances that are least vulnerable to the risks associated with Covid-19.
