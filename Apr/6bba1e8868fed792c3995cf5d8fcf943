Platinum group metals producer Eastern Platinum's (Eastplats)’ subsidiary, Barplats Mines, has been authorised to operate its tailings retreatment project at the Crocodile River mine at a reduced capacity and to transport and export the chrome concentrate produced by the retreatment project, despite South Africa being under a 21-day national lockdown. Barplats has reviewed and updated its startup plans to be consistent with the order, based on a significantly reduced work force, and will immediately implement a phased restart. Eastplats says it remains committed to the government’s direction to prevent the risk of the spread of Covid-19. It has produced risk assessments and adopted appropriate procedures to maintain a safe workplace for its employees and the communities in which it operates. The effects of Covid-19 are changing rapidly and the company notes that it cannot reasonably estimate at this time the impact of this or the lockdown, both of which could have material adverse effects on it business, liquidity and cash flows.
