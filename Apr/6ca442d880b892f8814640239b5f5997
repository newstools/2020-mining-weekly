Twiga Minerals Corporation, a joint venture between dual-listed Barrick Gold Corporation and the Tanzanian government, has announced a support programme to assist the country in combating and containing the Covid-19 pandemic. Barrick’s Africa and Middle East CEO, Willem Jacobs, says that, in addition to measures already introduced to protect workers and their families living around its mines, the company is contributing $1.7-million in the form of critical equipment and expertise to help prevent the spread of the virus in Tanzania. Of this amount, $960 000 is destined for the national level, $505 000 to the regional level and $250 000 to the local level. Jacobs says that, at the national level, Barrick will be concentrating its efforts and contributions on Mloganzila as an isolation unit for confirmed cases and the Mabibo hostel as a quarantine centre. Regional support will be focused on Musoma, Shinyanga and Geita, where isolation centres will be created and equipped. The company is engaging with the relevant regional commissioners to convert its support into immediate action. Jacobs says that, as a committed partner to Tanzania, the company will also be keeping its mines operational during this period to support the country’s economy. Barrick will also be engaging with its contractors and suppliers to enlist their support for the cause.
