Canadian gold miner Yamana on Wednesday announced a 25% increase in its annual dividend to $0.0625 a share, effective from the second quarter of 2020. This is the third dividend increase that the gold miner announced in the past year, for a cumulative total increase of 213%. These increases, Yamana explained, were part of a gradual and progressive approach to dividend increases, as the companyâ€™s cash balances continued to grow. The miner would announced its first-quarter earnings results on Thursday, before the market open.
