PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Takeover target Alto Metals has urged shareholders to reject a takeover offer from shareholder Goldsea Group, after the suitor declined to waive a minimum acceptance condition to the offer. Goldsea in March lodged a bidder’s statement offering 6.5c a share in cash for every Alto share held, and a separate cash offer for Alto options. The offer was subject to a 90% minimum acceptance condition. Alto on Monday told shareholders that unlisted Adaman Minerals in April bought more than 30.5-million of Alto’s shares, taking a 10.3% interest in the company, while also providing Alto with a confidential funding proposal, which the Alto board had declined on the basis of unacceptable terms. Alto said that it has requested formal confirmation of Adaman’s intention in respect of the Goldsea offer, but has not received this final confirmation. Concurrently, Alto has also requested that Golsea waive its minimum acceptance condition, given that Adaman is unlikely to accept the Goldsea offer. However, Goldsea has declined to request for a waiver. Alto noted that as a result, there was no reasonable basis to assume that the conditions of the Goldsea offer would be satisfied, with the company advising shareholders to reject the offer. However, the company noted that it could change its recommendation in the event of a variation of the offer.
