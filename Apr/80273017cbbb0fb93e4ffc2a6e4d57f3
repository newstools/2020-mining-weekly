Diamond bourses organisation, the World Federation of Diamond Bourses (WFDB), has elected Yoram Davash as president. His election took place at a meeting of the executive committee of the WFDB held via Zoom. He had already been elected president designate at a previous congress of the organisation. Davash succeeds Ernie Blom as president. The president of the organisation chairs the executive committee. The president may not be elected for more than three consecutive terms of office. The WFDB general assembly is required to meet every two years at World Diamond Congress – although on occasion, owing to special circumstances a three-year hiatus has occurred. In those years that the WFDB general assembly does not meet, the various bourses’ leadership assemble as a single location for high-level discussions, at what today is known as the President's Meeting.
