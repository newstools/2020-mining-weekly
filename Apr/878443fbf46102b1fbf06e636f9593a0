JSE-listed Kore Potash continues with detailed work on the Dougou Extension prefeasibility study, with publication envisioned in May. The Dougou Extension forms part of the company’s 97%-owned Sintoukola potash project, based in Congo-Brazzaville. “The Dougou Extension project with its very high grade and shallow potash deposit, as well as close proximity to the coastline and the major port of Pointe Noire, is ideally placed to produce potash at low cost for supply into the nearby and growing markets in Africa and South America,” says CE Brad Sampson. The company ended the quarter ended March 31 with $4.7-million of cash in the bank, but plans to raise additional capital in the second half of the year to continue funding its exploration and development programme, as well as fulfil its working capital requirements.
