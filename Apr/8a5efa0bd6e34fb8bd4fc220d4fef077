South America-focused gold developer Orosur Mining on Monday announced that CEO Ignacio Salazar will be stepping down and leave the company on July 17, to take up a new position as CEO of Highfield Resources – an Australia-listed mining company with assets in Spain. Salazar has been the CEO of Orosur since March 2013. A search for his replacement has started. Chairperson Louis Castro commented in a statement on Monday that Salazar had led the company through very challenging times. “He has been instrumental in transforming Orosur with the acquisition of the Anzá project in Colombia in 2014, building a strategic alliance with Newmont since 2018, as well as developing operations and progressing a fair solution in Uruguay for all stakeholders. We thank him for his significant service and dedication to the company and its shareholders.” Meanwhile, Highfield said that Salazar would be based in the company's head office in Pamplona, Spain, with an initial focus on obtaining the remaining permits and raising funds for the construction of Phase 1 of the company’s Muga project. Salazar was born and educated in Spain. “After 11 years with the company, it is with mixed feelings that I make the decision to depart from Orosur to move to Highfield which, I feel, is a natural step in my career. Orosur is moving into a new phase as an exploration and development company and I am confident that during the next three months, I will be handing over to a strong and well-balanced team with a strong platform to grow. I remain a friend of the company and wish all the best of success to the team, the board, our shareholders and other stakeholders," Salazar commented in a statement.
