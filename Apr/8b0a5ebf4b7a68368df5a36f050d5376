London-listed potash developer Emmerson started this year with a great deal of purpose, making progress on its feasibility study and a clear plan for the future to further de-risk the Khemisset project, in Morocco. Following a rigorous site selection trade-off study, the company has selected two sites for mining, a preferred site and a secondary site, both of which provide a great result for the project int terms of access to local infrastructure, lower decline costs and optimum locations for the process plant. The company finds that $2-milllion will be required to connect its preferred plant site to local road infrastructure, which will be used to transport the potash to the nearest port for export. Emmerson started work on an environmental- and social-impact assessment (Esia) in January, which, along with its application for a mining permit for the project, will be done during the second half of the year. As part of the Esia, Emmerson has partnered with the Rabat Scientific Institute, in Morocco, to provide scholarships to students to study animal species in the area around the Khemisset site. Not only will this provide key data for the Esia, but it also demonstrates the company’s high standard of corporate and social responsibility. Meanwhile, the company continues discussions with several potential partners for the future development of the project. The discussions cover potential financing options and potential technical partnerships, including with engineering, procurement and construction contractors. In light of Covid-19 spread protection measures in the country, Emmerson says it is fortunate in that its staff can continue the current work programme from home. The company has a healthy cash position of £1.6-million to progress the project’s studies and permitting process at least until late 2021.
