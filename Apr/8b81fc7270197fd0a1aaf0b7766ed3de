JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) –  A trio of top companies has partnered to protect frontline medical staff, patients and visitors at four major Gauteng State hospitals. AngloGold Ashanti, Sasol and Imperial are collectively providing bulk hand sanitiser supplies to Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic, Charlotte Maxeke Academic, Helen Joseph and Leratong hospitals. “A partnership that brings together not only capital, but complementary assets and skillsets will be vital to changing the course of the Covid-19 pandemic,” AngloGold VP health Dr Bafedile Chauke stated in a news release to Mining Weekly.

AngloGold said it remained in a state of high-alert and preparedness to deal with the global Covid-19 challenge presented, with its steps to prevent its spread including:
