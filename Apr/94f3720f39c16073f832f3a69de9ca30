PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Major BHP on Wednesday announced that it would establish a $2-million fund to support communities in proximity to its petroleum operations in North America and Trinidad and Tobago, as part of its efforts to combat Covid-19. “BHP stands shoulder to shoulder with the communities where we operate. Our company has a critical role to play in the collective efforts to defeat this virus, and its impacts on our people and our neighbours. From the continued safe operation of our business and protecting the wellbeing of our people to offering our small business partners reduced payment terms and donating much needed funds to our community partners, BHP is committed to doing our part for our people, our community and our economy,” said Operations Petroleum president Geraldine Slattery. “People are feeling a lot of uncertainty right now and we’re making this commitment to provide some reassurance that companies like BHP are going to be there and support in any way that we can.” The fund spend will focus on the regions surrounding BHP’s petroleum operations and areas of business, and to date, the company has made commitments to support a number of projects, including donations to medical professionals, employing restaurant workers to provide meals for medical workers, extending mental health services to first responders, while also contributing to essential community services. The miner in April this year announced that it would establish a A$50-million Vital Resources Fund to help support regional Australian communities in its areas of operation, and would hire an additional 1 500 staff across Australia to support its current workforce and stimulate the economy. The company has also moved to immediately pay outstanding invoices and moved to a seven-day payment terms for suppliers to both its Petroleum and Australian operations.
