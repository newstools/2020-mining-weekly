PERTH (miningweekly.com) â€“ ASX-listed Medusa Mining has resumed operations at the Co-O gold mine, in the Philippines. Operations were temporarily suspended last week after the province in which the Co-O mine is located was placed under Enhanced Community Quarantine following an Executive Order issued by the Provincial Governor in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Medusa applied to the relevant authorities seeking approval to continue its operations on a controlled scale. The company has now been granted permission to operate on certain conditions, including sourcing workers from only the immediate areas, which Medusa said would have some impact on the near-term production. The company said on Wednesday that the impacts of Covid-19, the Enhanced Community Quarantine and travel restrictions would continue to be monitored, and the company would respond accordingly.
