As supply of sanitisers continues to run low owing to high demand, national mineral research organisation Mintek has produced more than 600 ℓ of hand and surface sanitisers to use and distribute to staff. Sanitisers were produced in Mintek's controlled laboratory environment in the Advanced Materials Division and then production was scaled up by the Hydrometallurgy Division. Products were packed and labelled in accordance with the national guidelines in 500 mℓ, 1 ℓ, 2.5 ℓ and 5 ℓ bottles. Some of these were distributed to staff to take home prior to the national lockdown, while others continue to be used in various locations throughout the Mintek campus by essential services staff on duty. With a daily foot traffic of around 700 people, including full-time staff, visitors and contractors, Mintek says the company could not keep up with the excessive consumption considering the suppressed supply at the same time keeping up with maintaining hygiene standards. Advanced Materials Division principal scientist Dr Mabel Coyanis says Mintek hand sanitiser was produced according to the World Health Organisation recommended formulation, with a composition of ethanol, hydrogen peroxide and glycerol. “The preparation of sanitisers is not something new for Mintek, as the formula for surface sanitising is of critical use within the laboratory environment. The addition of glycerol to the product is intended as a skincare moisturiser.” Mintek expects to increase production of sanitisers for further distribution to the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy.
