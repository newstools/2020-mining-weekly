Gold producer Caledonia Mining’s Blanket mine, in Zimbabwe, produced 14 233 oz of gold in the quarter ended March 31, a 19% increase on the 11 948 oz produced in the corresponding quarter of 2019. CEO Steve Curtis credits the operational team for the increase and says the operational improvements in the latter part of 2019 have continued into this year. Notwithstanding travel restrictions in Zimbabwe, Caledonia remains in production and is maintaining good levels of output, he notes. Subject to the mine not experiencing any unforeseen production interruptions associated with the Covid-19 pandemic, Curtis anticipates the mine’s quarterly production profile to “be more evenly balanced” throughout this year because of the increased focus on development.

“To begin the year with a strong start, at a time of firm gold prices, has established a strong base which is helpful in withstanding any disruptions that may arise as a result of the current Covid-19 pandemic,” he comments.
