ASX-, Aim- and JSE-listed Kore Potash has been granted 25-year certificates of environmental compliance by the Congo-Brazzaville government for the Dougou and Kola mining licences. The environmental- and social-impact assessments (ESIAs) for both licences previously required reapproval on a yearly or three-yearly basis. The licences are part of the company’s Sintoukola project. The company anticipates completing a preliminary feasibility study on the Dougou Extension project this quarter. The company plans to seek approval for amendments to the ESIA for the Dougou mining licence to include the planned mining and processing of the DX sylvinite deposit, which sits within the licence area, in due course. “We are pleased with the continued support of the government of Congo-Brazzaville. The 25-year ESIA period is now aligned with the timeframe of the mining convention between Kore and the government, which was passed into law. This offers improved certainty for all parties and stakeholders. “As we progress the development of the DX project and move towards first potash production, we will apply for amendments to the Dougou ESIA as part of the DX permitting process,” says Kore CEO Brad Sampson.
