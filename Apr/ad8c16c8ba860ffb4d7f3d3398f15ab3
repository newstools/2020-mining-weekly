Aim-listed Anglo Asian Mining has made a further shipment of gold doré bars containing 4 688 oz of gold to MKS Finance, in Switzerland, by way of air-charter. This follows after the company in March stated that owing to the cessation of scheduled air flights amid the Covid-19 pandemic, the company was looking at other logistics options for the shipment and sale of gold doré. The gold was produced at Anglo Asian’s copper and silver mine Gedabek, in Azerbaijan. CEO Reza Vaziri says the successful consignment of gold to MKS Finance demonstrates the company’s agility despite the operational problems presented by Covid-19. He adds that the gold refiners based in Switzerland expect to soon resume limited working. Anglo Asian is ascertaining when it can start with further shipments of gold. Anglo Asian is also in discussion with to other refiners in its own region to provide an alternative channel for the refining and sale of its gold and silver bullion. Operations at the Gedabek mine continue, while the company is mindful of staff health and safety.
