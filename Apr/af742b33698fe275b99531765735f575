Gold major Barrick has handed a $530 000 cheque to Zambia as a donation to support the country in combating and containing the Covid-19 pandemic. Barrick country manager for Zambia, Nathan Chishimba, said on Tuesday that the company had already introduced extensive measures to protect workers and their families living in and around its Lumwana mine against the virus. “As a committed partner to Zambia we would also like to make a contribution to the government’s fight against the pandemic. We are consequently funding the provision of medical equipment to the value of $340 000 at the national level, $100 000 for the North-Western province and $90 000 for the Kalumbila district,” he said. Barrick’s COO for Africa and the Middle East, Willem Jacobs, commented in a statement the company was engaging with Zambia’s national Covid-19 taskforce to convert its support into immediate action. Its senior management in Zambia was working closely with the local health authorities. Zambia has 39 cases of Covid-19 and has reported one death. Globally, the pandemic has infected more than 1.4-million people and caused the deaths of about 82 000.
