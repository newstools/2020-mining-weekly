London-listed Rainbow Rare Earths has exported a further 100 t of concentrate, after having exported 75 t in February. The company has steadily increased production at its Gakara mine, in Burundi, and commissioning of a fleet of five new trucks will grow production further, which will be assisted by drier weather conditions. Rainbow confirms that the impact of Covid-19 in Burundi has been limited to the closure of some borders, but the company continues to export goods through the land border with Tanzania. The Gakara mineral basket is weighted more towards magnet rare earths, such as neodymium and praseodymium.
