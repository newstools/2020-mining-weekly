PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Gold miner Gold Road Resources has set an exploration budget of A$26-million for the 2020 financial year, with the miner saying on Tuesday that the majority of this work would be geared towards discoveries on the Yamarna belt, in Western Australia. Gold Road holds 4 500 km2 of land position on the Yamarna belt, where early stage regional infill and first pass aircore drilling has focused on the high priority Hirono and Bluebell targets, in the Southern project area. “Exciting new results at Gilmour have identified scope to expand this high-grade resource. Drilling completed so far this year has focused on initial regional assessment of our highest-ranking early stage targets in the Southern projects area, with good progress made in completing the 18 000 m Hirono programme,” said executive director for discovery and growth, Justin Osborn. “With results still coming through, we expect to have new, more detailed targets generated in the coming months for follow-up testing.” The company said on Tuesday that to date, the Covid-19 pandemic had not impacted on its exploration work programmes at Yamarna, however, work had been temporarily suspended at the Cygnus joint venture, in south-west Western Australia.
