South Africa’s Department of Mineral Resources and Energy has granted KwaZulu-Natal miner Buffalo Coal permission to resume mining activities at 30% operating capacity. The company, which is listed on the TSX-V, said on Thursday it would resume mining activities on a limited scale on April 14, following the Easter long weekend. It will do so within the framework of the company’s policies on Covid-19 and in line with local and national healthy authority requirements. South Africa implemented a 21-day national lockdown, which was meant to end on April 16, but has now been extended to April 30.
