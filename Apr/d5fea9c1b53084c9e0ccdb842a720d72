Midtier gold producer Centamin, operator of the Sukari gold mine, has committed ten-million Egyptian pounds, equivalent to about $635 000, to support Egypt's response efforts to combat the coronavirus pandemic.

"We continue to closely monitor the situation, adapting our processes and procedures accordingly. We are actively working with the Egyptian government to address the threat of Covid-19, providing logistical and financial support within our local community. "We thank the Egyptian government for their support and working collaboratively in sustaining operations at Sukari,‚Äù the company says. As of April 5, Centamin had no recorded cases of Covid-19 on site and has experienced no material disruption to operations, its supply chain or gold shipments.
