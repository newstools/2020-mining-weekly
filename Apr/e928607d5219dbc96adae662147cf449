Gold producer Nordgold has started large-scale Covid-19 testing at its mines. To date, 282 employees have been tested at its Holba mine, in Russia, with zero cases being diagnosed. All incoming rotational staff at Nordgold’s other mines in Russia will be tested prior to arrival on site. Further, 1 350 test kits have to date been delivered to the Lefa mine, in Guinea, and tests for employees and contractors at the company’s mines in Burkina Faso have been bought and are expected to be delivered on site shortly. Nordgold is also supporting Burkina Faso in its efforts to tackle the spread of the virus through donating vital medical and personal protective equipment (PPE) to the Ministry of Health of Burkina Faso and has launched a large-scale communications campaign for the local communities near its its Bissa-Bouly and Taparko mines. During the campaign, the PPE, including essentials such as masks, gloves and hand sanitisers, will be donated to local health clinics. The company’s contribution has exceeded $100 000. In Kazakhstan, meanwhile, testing of the Suzdal mine employees will start as soon as the local laboratory receives the necessary tests and reagents. CEO Nikolai Zelenski commented that employee testing, alongside other preventive measures, to mitigate the spread of Covid-19, “should significantly reduce the risk of contamination and enable business to continue undisrupted”.
