TSX-V-listed Strongbow has announced that its drilling partner Cornish Lithium has discovered a new zone of high-grade copper/tin mineralisation at its United Downs exploration project, in Cornwall, UK. Cornish Lithium has the right to explore Strongbow’s mineral rights in Cornwall for lithium in brine occurrences while Strongbow retains the right to any hard rock mineralisation. The mining district where the discovery was made, called Gwennap, was the richest copper production region in the world in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Cornish Lithium’s drilling in the area intersected semi-massive sulphide mineralisation, with assay results including 14.69 m grading 7.46% copper, 1.19% tin and 0.15% zinc from 90.6 m to 105 m downhole depth. The company is drilling further to confirm the true width of the mineralisation, as well as the strike and dip of the mineralised zone. Three individual sample intervals returned assays greater than 20% copper, which be finally reported on soon. Strongbow says the mineralisation is similar in style to that mined at the Wheal Jane and Mount Wellington mines, which are located 1.5 km along strike to the east.
