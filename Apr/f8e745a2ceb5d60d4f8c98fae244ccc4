PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The Queensland Resources Council (QRC) has welcomed a decision by diversified miner Glencore to extend its 2021 Graduate Development Programme, providing graduate opportunities in regional Australia. With a focus on local talent from regional communities, the company’s Graduate Development Programme combines structured, professional development with on-the-job experience and mentoring from Glencore staff. Glencore said this week that the additional intake of graduates reflected the company’s commitment to provide resource graduate opportunities across regional Australian in its coal, copper and zinc operations. The QRC on Wednesday said that with the ongoing uncertainty in Australia’s job market, Glencore’s decision was welcome. QRC CEO Ian Macfarlane said it was another example of the resources sector’s critical role in buffering the economy as the impacts of Covid-19 unfold. “Glencore is providing the career opportunities across its coal, copper and zinc operations and has already welcomed over 100 new graduates to its operations this year bringing the current total to more than 220. “A QRC survey of the state’s resources companies taken during the Covid-19 outbreak found that 58% of companies were maintaining or planning to grow current workforce numbers over the next three months and only 21%, or one-in-five, expected a decrease. “During these turbulent times the resources sector is considered an essential industry by both the federal and state governments to fast-track the economy to recovery mode.”
