Gold miner Perseus Mining is donating $387 500, comprising cash and goods, to assist its host governments and host communities in Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire in their efforts to fight the spread of Covid-19 in West Africa.

As of April 6, there continue to be no cases of Covid-19 infection reported by any of Perseus’ employees or contractors operating at its Edikan and Sissingué gold mines, or at the Yaouré gold mine construction site. To the miner’s knowledge, this also extends to the residents of host communities located adjacent to those operations. It is Perseus’ intention, that its financial assistance will be delivered to local health service providers, thereby helping to maintain the status quo. Supply chains for each of Perseus’ operating sites remain open in both Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire although movement of both local and foreign employees is currently impacted by government-imposed travel restrictions. The company has implemented a series of protocols at each of its operating sites aimed at eliminating the possibility of infection of members of its workforce needed to ensure business continuity. “A healthy local community, while an important consideration in its own right, will materially assist this situation,” says Perseus. CEO and MD Jeff Quartermaine says the company will be working closely with Ghanaian and Ivorian officials to ensure that its donations are directed to assist its host communities do all in their power to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
