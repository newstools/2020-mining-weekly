SAO PAULO â€“ Brazilian miner Vale has stopped using very large crude carrier (VLCC) ships converted into very large ore carriers (VLOC), following a final delivery to China on Sunday, according to a securities filing on Monday. Vale had said in January it would stop using the converted ships, opting instead for long-term contracts using more modern Valemax and Guaibamax ships.
