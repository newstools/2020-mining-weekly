PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Western Australian miners would now have to ensure that diesel particulate matter (DPM) does not exceed 0.1 milligrams per cubic metre of air in the workplace, after the state government made changes to the workplace exposure standards. While mine operators were previously encouraged to ensure DPM was kept as low as possible, compliance was voluntary. Mines and Petroleum Minister Bill Johnston on Friday said that introducing the exposure standard follows extensive scientific research into DPM exposure risks and consultation with the mining sector, and it would be implemented immediately as industry should already have controls in place. “The government is committed to safety and this new workplace exposure standard is a big win for mineworkers. We will continue to work with the mining sector to ensure operators are managing risks and applying the new diesel particulate matter exposure standards,” Johnston said. "Healthy mine sites are the bedrock that underpins the government's goal to make Western Australia the world's safest mining environment." The new standards follow the workplace exposure standard for respirable crystalline silica being halved to 0.05 milligrams per cubic metre as of October 27, and respirable coal dust being halved to 1.5 milligrams per cubic metre effective October 2021.
