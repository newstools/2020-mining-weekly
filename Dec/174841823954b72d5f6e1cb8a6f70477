Aim-listed tin miner AfriTin Mining successfully completed Stage 1 of the Phase 1 production ramp-up of its pilot mining and processing facility, achieving 63.9 t of tin concentrate (containing 41.6 t of tin metal) in November – a 32% improvement on the previous month. Following enhancement initiatives implemented over the course of the year, the performance of the operation has exceeded nameplate production and reached this milestone prior to the end of the year as previously projected. With its flagship asset, the Uis mine, AfriTin managed to complete about 107% of the Stage 1 target in terms of tin concentrate tonnes produced and 116% of the Stage 1 target in terms of tin contained in concentrate. AfriTin Mining CEO Anthony Viljoen says this is a defining milestone. “This success speaks volumes for the high-quality nature of the asset and the calibre of our management team, whom I would like to sincerely congratulate given the macro challenges faced by the global pandemic.” He adds that this accomplishment provides AfriTin with the platform to progress, with proven confidence, its development plan for the Uis mine towards a large-scale mining and processing facility. Tin concentrate production for the year to date totals 301 t and, despite Covid-19-related restrictions, shipping of tin concentrate through the port of Walvis Bay to the offtake partner in Thailand continues unabated. Going forward, AfriTin will focus on maintaining steady state production, while exploring opportunities for further enhancement and expansion of the operation. These opportunities include a modular expansion of the plant throughput and potential production of a by-product in the form of a tantalum concentrate. AfriTin is conducting test work to investigate the feasibility of magnetically separating tantalum minerals from the tin concentrate. Meanwhile, AfriTin also reports no confirmed cases of Covid-19 at its Uis mine.
