The Iron Ore Company of Canada (IOC) and College of the North Atlantic (CNA) have signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to collaborate on the development of new skills aligned with the latest advancements in mining technology. The Rio Tinto subsidiary will invest C$2-million over three years in this initiative. Rio Tinto points out that IOC is gradually implementing new, more technically advanced systems, as well as autonomous and highly instrumented equipment to continue improving its safety performance and competitiveness. This digital transformation creates the need to help current employees develop different skillsets and to establish a pipeline of qualified, local talent for the future. IOC and CNA will cooperate across three main areas: workforce development, work assignments for college students and faculty, and applied research opportunities in the mining sector. In addition to the creation of new future skills training programmes for the mining industry at the college, the MoU is expected to lead to the development of internship opportunities at IOC.
