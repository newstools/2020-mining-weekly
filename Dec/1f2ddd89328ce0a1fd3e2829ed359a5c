The James Bay Native Development Corporation/Cree Development Corporation, the James Bay Development Corporation, the Société du Plan Nord and the Town of Matagami on Tuesday signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to deliver strategic infrastructure aimed at ensuring the vitality of Matagami and the entire region, in an environmentally responsible manner. This partnership, which is part of the philosophy of the Grand Alliance concluded between the Cree Nation and the Gouvernement du Québec in February 2019, aims to develop the territory's infrastructure according to an integrated and sustainable socioeconomic development perspective, in keeping with traditional Cree values, in order to connect, develop and protect the Territory. This advancement will provide a tangible contribution to Matagami's economic plan to address the challenges expected in the coming months given the announced closure of Matagami mine. The MoU focuses on the development of infrastructure to support sustainable ore processing in Québec. Among other things, the partnership will minimise the environmental footprint of mining projects through the upgrading of equipment and the use of existing infrastructure. The first aim of this agreement is to optimise the existing transportation infrastructure in order to foster economic benefits in the geographic area of response of the parties. This innovative partnership will increase the economic value of projects by reducing not only their costs, but also the risks and uncertainties associated with them, ensuring a predictable and stable development for the proponents in the region. "The goal of the government is to make Québec a leader in the development of critical and strategic minerals, in partnership with regional and indigenous communities. This alliance fits perfectly within the government's policy and I am pleased to see that the strategic players in the Northern Quebec region are working together to achieve this,” commented Energy and Natural Resources Minister Jonatan Julien.
