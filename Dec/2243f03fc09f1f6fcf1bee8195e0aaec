Russian miner Trans-Siberian on Tuesday announced an updated production guidance for 2020, with output expected to be a record 44 000 oz to 45 000 oz of gold dore. This compares with the previous 2020 full-year guidance of 38 000 oz to 42 000 oz. The London-listed company said that it had made significant progress in 2020, in particular with the transition towards the East Zone of the Asacha gold mine, with test ore from Vein 25 contributing towards higher-than-expected average grades in the second and third quarters. In the eleven months to November 30, the group produced 40 297 oz. “This is a strong achievement in a challenging year and a testament to the quality and grades of the orebody at Vein 25, as well as to the endeavour and resilience of our team in Kamchatka,” commented CEO Alexander Dorogov in a statement.
