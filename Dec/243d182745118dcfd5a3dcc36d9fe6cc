Gold miner Harmony Gold Mining has maintained its CDP A-rating for water management. The CDP is an international nonprofit organisation based in the UK, Germany and the US and helps companies and cities disclose their environmental impact. Harmony did not participate in the climate element of the CDP, as the company transitioned to the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure for the first time this year. “We are thrilled with our continued inclusion in the CDP. ESG is important for Harmony’s long-term business value-creation. "We will continue to provide insight into the company’s ESG performance and ensure that this information is both readily available and relevant,” says Harmony CEO Peter Steenkamp.
