PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Coal miner Coronado Global Resources has tapped mining services provider NRW Holding’s subsidiary Golding Contractors to increase mining plant at the Curragh mine, in Queensland. NRW on Wednesday said that it would introduce a fifth and sixth fleet at Curragh, in addition to its current mining operations, with the additional fleet to include Hitachi EX5600 and EX3600 excavators, with 13 Hitachi EH400 trucks along with ancillary plant. NRW noted that the additional fleet would add some A$50-million to the company’s existing contract with Coronado, which has an indicative value of A$107-million over the remaining term to completion in September 2021, with Golding also starting negotiations to extend the contract beyond this date. The addition of the two fleets is expected to create opportunities for some 150 new personnel, NRW said, with the majority of the fleet to be sourced internally from NRW. Coronado has been increasing production levels at the Curragh mine to recover lost production and overburden from the first half of the year, with the miner in the September quarter reporting a 15.2% increase in run-of-mine production, to reach 4.3-million tonnes. Saleable coal production was also up 24.5% from the previous quarter, to 3.6-million tonnes.
