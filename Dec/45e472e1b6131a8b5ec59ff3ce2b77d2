Aim-listed BlueRock Diamonds has recovered a 12.6 ct diamond from its Kareevlei diamond mine in the Kimberley region of South Africa. Executive chairperson Mike Houston said on Friday that the discovery was “exceptional”. “To put this into perspective, given the average engagement ring weight in the UK is 0.6 ct, a 12.6 ct diamond is considered exceptional.  We are hopeful that the recovery of this diamond marks the start of mining better quality diamonds, having worked through a difficult area in recent months,” he stated.
