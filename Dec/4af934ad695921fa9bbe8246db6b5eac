PERTH (miningweekly.com) â€“ Precious metals junior Manuka Resources has warned that operations at its Wonawinta processing plant, in New South Wales, will be halted for a period of four to five days, to allow for repairs. Certain machinery and auxiliary housing and shedding infrastructure was damaged at the Wonawinta site following a severe localized weather event, where exceptionally high winds and heavy rains were reported. While no injuries were reported, the storm caused some A$1-million in damages to the Wonawinta infrastructure. Manuka on Monday said that the company had already located replacement equipment for anything identified as potentially damaged, where spares were not carried on site. The Wonawinta plant currently treats ore from the Mt Boppy gold project and will process ore from the Wonawinta silver and base metals project.
