Canadian mining company Sierra Metals is considering expanding its Cusi mine, in Mexico, with a preliminary economic assessment (PEA) delivering encouraging results. The PEA is proposing an expansion of the production rate from 1 200 t/d to 2 400 t/d. The incremental benefit of doubling the production is estimated to have an aftertax net present value of $28.1-million and an internal rate of return of 46.8%. CEO Luis Marchese comments in a statement that the PEA has studied the value of the current operations at Cusi at 1 200 t/d against several output expansion alternatives – from 2 400 t/d to 3 500 t/d and determined 2 400 t/d as the optimum production level based on the current mineral resource base. “Cusi is the smallest of our three mining operations, however, its silver resources which include 31.3-million ounces of measured and indicated plus 23-million ounces of inferred provide Sierra Metals with economic leverage to the improving silver market fundamentals,” he says. Over a 13-year mine life, Cusi will produce 33.4-million ounces of payable silver.
