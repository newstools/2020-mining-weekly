PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Oil and gas producer Woodside on Thursday revealed that the company’s Australian entities had paid a combined A$583-million in income tax during the 2018/19 financial year. The company told shareholders that in 2019, Woodside paid A$447-million in Australian corporate income tax and a further A$290-million in other taxes and royalties. Woodside has paid more than A$10-billion in Australian taxes and royalties over the decade to 2020. Woodside CEO Peter Coleman said the company had made a significant contribution over many years. “We are a proud Australian company and we do the right thing when it comes to paying our taxes in Australia. As one of the country’s largest taxpayers, Woodside is subject to the Australian Taxation Office’s (ATO’s) Justified Trust programme, where we have obtained the highest assurance rating. “This achievement, attained by only 30% of the top 100 taxpayers, means that the ATO is assured that Woodside is paying the right amount of income tax. “We value the trust of our employees, contractors, suppliers and customers, and we know that transparency and accountability are core to maintaining that trust,” he said.
