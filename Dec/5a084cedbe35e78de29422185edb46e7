State-owned Angolan National Diamond Trading Company (Sodiam) says it has received interest from five global tender and auction houses related to the development of these services in the soon to be established Angolan Diamond Bourse (ADB). Angola has about 14 active diamond mining sites and produced more than nine-million carats in 2019. "One of the main objectives of the ADB is to put the enormous flow of these diamonds under one roof. It is also understood that a percentage of these diamonds could be sold through a professional and public tender," comments Angola Mineral Resources and Petroleum Minister Diamantino Azevedo. “We have received interest from Bonas-Couzyn, First Element, I-Hennig & Co, Koin International and Trans Atlantic Gem Sales and are now investigating which services would suit Angola’s needs in the best possible way in accordance with the law of the country,” adds ADB special coordinator Peter Meeus. Sodiam is also examining cooperation with two providers of deep-boiling services – Elmyr Services and Quality Boiling (Charlotte) – for the ADB. “Both Elmyr and Charlotte have sent in their proposals which are being examined. Both companies have offices in Antwerp and Dubai, the leading rough diamond centres. "It is our intention to have a deep-boiling facility in the new ADB. Before being offered for sale to customers, rough diamonds could go through a deep boiling process, which shall be conducted in the premises of the ADB for the purpose of local beneficiation and price maximisation,” says Meeus. The ADB will also include a gemmological academy and a technological research centre and will be embedded in a free trade zone.
