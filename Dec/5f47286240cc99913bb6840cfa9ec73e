PERTH (miningweekly.com) – An additional two-million tonnes of exports have been secured for the Geraldton port over the next two years, after the Mid West Ports Authority, has signed port services agreements with three resources companies set to export from Geraldton for the first time. Fenix Resources will export 1.25-million tonnes a year from its Iron Ridge iron ore projects, located 490 km north-east of Geraldton, with first shipment expected in early 2021.  Furthermore, the GWR Group will export 500 000 t/y for its C4 Wiluna iron-ore Stage 1 project, with first shipment also expected in early 2021, while Strandline Resources will export 230 000 t/y of mineral sands from its Coburn project, 240km north of Geraldton, starting in 2022. “New resources projects are coming online through the Mid-West, the region's economy is on the up. These port services agreements will see a significant expansion of exports through Geraldton port over the next two years, creating local jobs in Geraldton and across the region,” said Ports Minister Alannah MacTiernan.  "Our government is getting on with diversifying the Mid-West economy, creating local jobs in the community and facilitating growth right across the state.  "Our investments at Geraldton port mean trade can continue to expand, ensuring a bright future for the city and the region." Earlier this year, the state government endorsed the Port of Geraldton Master Plan, charting growth at the port over the next 15 years up to 50-million tonnes a year throughput, from 14.95-million tonnes a year in 2019-20.  Through the Western Australian Recovery Plan, the government has funded the A$10-million Wharf 4 strengthening and rail replacement project to upgrade a key piece of Geraldton port infrastructure, paving the way for long-term growth in mineral sands export from Geraldton.  Wharf 4 is the primary export wharf for mineral sands, talc and concentrates from Geraldton port, and will be used by Strandline Resources.
