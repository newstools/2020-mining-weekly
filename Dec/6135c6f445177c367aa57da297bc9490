ASX-, Aim- and JSE-listed Kore Potash has assured the Minister of Mines of Congo-Brazzaville of the progress being made at its Dougou Extention (DX) and Kola projects. This follows after the company received correspondence from the Minister, expressing his disappointment at the speed of progress on the development of projects in the Sintoukola basin in Congo-Brazzaville. "Kore continues to communicate constructively and openly with the Minister of Mines to ensure the parties remain fully engaged as Kore progresses the development of its projects," the company assured shareholders in a December 14 update. Kore earlier this month reported that the definitive feasibility study for Phase 1 of the DX project remained on track to be completed in May 2021. Mining Weekly had reported in November that the DX project was chosen as a 400 000 t/y starter project for the larger Kola underground mining project. The Kola project, at a $2-billion-plus capital cost, had proved difficult to fund, prompting Kore to switch focus to first developing the DX project.
