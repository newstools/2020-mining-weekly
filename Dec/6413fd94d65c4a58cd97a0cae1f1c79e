PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Element 25 has received key environmental approvals for its manganese project, in Western Australia. The company on Friday reported that the works approval and the mining proposal had been approved by the relevant state government departments, while permission has also been obtained from the state Mining Engineer, allowing construction and mining operations to start. Element 25 told shareholders that these approvals were the final milestone required for construction to start on the Butcherbird project. “We are delighted to have secured the necessary environmental approvals for the start of construction at the project. This is the culmination of an extensive environmental assessment and community consultation process and it allows Element 25 to continue to rapidly progress its mine development and construction plans,” said MD Justin Brown. “The company has had an accelerated development timeline in place from the start and the fact that it continues to deliver the project on time and on budget is a testament to the dedication of the Element 25 team.” The Butcherbird operation is expected to produce 341 000 t/y of manganese concentrate, at a grade of 33% manganese, over a mine life of 40 years. Work crews are being mobilised to undertake the necessary civil works to allow for commissioning of the project in the first quarter of 2021, while the water abstraction licence remains pending.
