PERTH (miningweekly.com) â€“ Diamond miner Lucapa has recovered a 101 ct white diamond from its Mothae kimberlite mine in Lesotho. The diamond was measured as D in colour, type IIa, and is the fourth diamond larger than 100 ct recovered from the southern lobe of the Mothae kimberlite pipe. Lucapa on Thursday said that the recovery of this diamond reinforced the quality and large stone carrying capacity of the Mothae resource, which is considered to be one of the highest quality kimberlite diamond mines in the world. Lucapa earlier this week recovered a 127 ct diamond from its Lulo alluvial mine, in Angola, marking the sixteenth stone larger than 100 ct to be recovered at that operation to date.
