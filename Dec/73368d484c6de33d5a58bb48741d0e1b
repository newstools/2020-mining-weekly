PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Gold miner Regis Resources has approved the A$76-million development of the Garden Well South underground mine, in Western Australia. Development of the mine is expected to start in the March quarter of next year, and processing of the first underground development ore is scheduled for the December quarter of the same year, with stope production to start in the June quarter of 2022. Underground ore mining rates are scheduled to be at a rate of some 600 000 t/y, once stoping activities stabilise. The Garden Well South underground operation is estimated to host a mineral resource of some 2.4-million tonnes, grading 3.6 g/t gold for 270 000 oz of contained gold, with the feasibility study estimating that some 190 000 oz of gold would be recovered at the mine, with some 176 000 oz of gold produced. Regis said on Monday that there was considerable opportunity for additional resources down plunge of the existing Garden Well South resource, extending the current expected mine life of four years. “The development decision for a second underground mine at our Duketon operation is another major milestone in the Regis goal of delivering increased shareholder value through organic growth projects,” said MD Jim Beyer. “This new underground mine will be a key element to achieving and maintaining our aim for the for the Duketon operation to become a reliable 400 000 oz/y producer. Further, we believe that the approved Garden Well underground is not only a robust investment in its current form, but just as importantly has the potential to increase life and value through down plunge exploration.”
