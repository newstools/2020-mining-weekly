Dual-listed Altus Strategies has discovered further copper and silver mineralisation at the company’s wholly owned Agdz project, in Morocco. The discovery follows a previously announced predictive mapping project. Programmes at other prospects continue to generate “encouraging results”, including 3.59% copper and 149 g/t silver from the 1.4-km-long Makarn South prospect; 4.67% copper and 308 g/t silver from the 1.4-km-long Makarn North prospect; 2.45% copper and 2.25% copper from the 2-km-long Amzwaro prospect; as well as 2.12% copper and 1.99% copper from the 150-m-long Miniére prospect. Altus will be undertaking mapping and induced polarisation geophysical surveys in the first quarter of 2021. According to CE Steven Poulton, “while mineralisation hosted at Bou Skour is not necessarily indicative of that at Agdz, the project is clearly exceptionally well located in an established and highly prospective mining district”.
