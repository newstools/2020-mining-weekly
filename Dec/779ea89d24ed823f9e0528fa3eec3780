Gold miner Great Panther Mining has restarted operations at Topia, in Mexico, following a voluntary suspension last month to prioritise the health of its workforce and local community and limit the spread of Covid-19. Mining resumed on December 17 and the plant is expected to begin processing ore on December 21. The suspension, which lasted 30 days, should not impact on the companyâ€™s ability to achieve its 2020 production guidance, says Great Panther. For the three months ended September 30, Topia produced an average of 1 400 gold-equivalent ounces a month.
