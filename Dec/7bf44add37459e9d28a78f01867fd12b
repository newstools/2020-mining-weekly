TSX-V-listed Canada Nickel Company has entered a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Matachewan and Mattagami First Nations in relation to exploration and development operations at the Crawford nickel/cobalt sulphide project near Timmins, Ontario. The MoU establishes a commitment by Canada Nickel to engage in ongoing consultation and establish a mutually beneficial cooperative and productive relationship with the First Nations located in the project area. The agreement also provides the communities with an opportunity to participate in the benefits of the project through business opportunities, employment and training, financial compensation and consultation on environmental matters. â€œCanada Nickel is fully committed to the responsible development of the Crawford nickel/cobalt sulphide project to deliver NetZero Nickel and Cobalt products. From the very beginning, our approach has been to work with First Nations and local stakeholders as partners in order to create shared value through economic opportunities, while also being respectful and responsible stewards of the natural environment," said chairperson and CEO Mark Selby. The project is in the heart of the prolific Timmins-Cochrane mining camp in Ontario and is adjacent to well-established, major infrastructure associated with over 100 years of regional mining activity. Canada Nickel has launched wholly-owned NetZero Metals with the aim to develop zero-carbon production of nickel, cobalt, and iron at the Crawford project.
