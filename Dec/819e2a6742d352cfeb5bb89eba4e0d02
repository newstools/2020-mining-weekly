Gender equality nonprofit organisation International Women in Mining (IWiM) has announced the launch of its 2021 International Women in Resources Mentoring Programme (IWRMP) in collaboration with organisational specialist Metisphere. The programme seeks to actively empower women in the mining sector by providing mentees with opportunities to accelerate their all-round professional growth. The IWRMP will run from April to October next year and will be the fourth consecutive edition of the programme. IWiM says it has so far secured support from global miners Rio Tinto, Newmont Corporation, New Gold and Centerra Gold, as well as from consultancy SRK Consulting. “What makes IWRMP unique is its combination of global reach and intersectionality, which enable mentees to benefit from contact with mentors and fellow mentees that may not otherwise have been possible. The programme is designed to meet the needs of the highly globalised mining sector, both now and into the future,” says programme director Barbara Dischinger. She adds that the organisation looks forward to having more companies within the sector participate in 2021, as the programme is equally beneficial to mentors. “It is a high-performance framework that fosters a ‘reverse mentoring’ attitude that gives senior industry figures, both male and female, an opportunity to further hone their leadership skills,” Dischinger points out. Similar to this year's programme, IWRMP 2021 will be a fully online offering. Since its initial launch, 130 mentees and 44 scholarship recipients have participated in this initiative.
