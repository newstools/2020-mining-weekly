PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Diamond miner Lucapa has recovered a 127 ct gem-quality white diamond from its Lulo alluvial mine, in Angola. The diamond marked the sixteenth stone of more than 100 ct to be recovered from Lulo to date, and the third diamond of that size recovered in 2020. “The recovery of this 127 ct stone continues to showcase the exceptional nature of the Lulo alluvial deposit, and highlights the potential of the mining campaign planned for these previously untouched and expansive leziria areas along the Cacuilo river,” said MD Stephen Wetherall. The stone was recovered from the leziria area in mining block 24 as part of the targeted dry season operations, and is the first stone of this size produced from this area.
