Dual-listed Pure Gold Mining has reached a major milestone at its namesake mine, in Red Lake, Ontario, by introducing first ore to the mill, setting it on a path to first gold production this month. With more than 21 t tonnes of broken ore available, crushing has started and first ore has been introduced to the grinding circuit at a rate of about 25 t/h, or 600 t/d. "This is a very exciting day for our shareholders, the community of Red Lake, and our entire team," stated CEO Darin Labrenz. "The introduction of ore to the milling facility reflects the successful culmination of our project build, and signals the commencement of the next chapter in our company's evolution as Canada's newest gold mine.” Labrenz pointed out that PureGold had progressed from its first drill hole to production in less than six years. As the second operating mine in Red Lake, the PureGold mine is a significant contributor to the economy of the region. The mine currently employs more than 200 people and the workforce is expected to average 350 individuals during the 12-year phase one mine operation with about C$470-million in life of mine salaries projected over that period.
