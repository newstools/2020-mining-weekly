Hilary Maxson will join the Anglo American board as a nonexecutive director and member of the audit committee with effect from June 1, 2021. “[Maxson] brings a combination of experience that aligns well with our business, spanning finance, the capital markets, energy and technology, gained across her executive career in the US, Europe, Africa and Asia,” says Anglo chairperson Stuart Chambers. Jim Rutherford will, meanwhile, retire as nonexecutive director with effect from December 31. Rutherford has served as an independent nonexecutive director since November 2013 and also served on the board’s audit, remuneration and sustainability committees.
