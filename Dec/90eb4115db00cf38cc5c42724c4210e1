PERTH (miningweekly.com) - Iron-ore miner Fortescue Metals has marked the first ore through its Eliwana ore processing facility, in Western Australia. CEO Elizabeth Gaines on Wednesday said that the Eliwana mine and rail project was the next important stage of development of Fortescue’s integrated operations. “Exploration commenced in this area in 2006, and we have now delivered a new 30-million-tonne-a-year dry processing facility and infrastructure, along with 143 km of rail which is in the final stages of construction. “Eliwana will see us maintain our low-cost status and provide us with greater flexibility across our product mix. Construction of the mine, village and infrastructure was completed safely over a 12-month period, in line with our budget and schedule,” Gaines said. Western Australian Mines and Petroleum Minister Bill Johnston congratulated Fortescue on the opening of the Eliwana mine, pointing out that the project would create some 500 full-time jobs as it moved into operation. "Fortescue's Eliwana mine will deliver a significant boost to Western Australia's economy, during the post-Covid-19 recovery phase, and contribute to the state's ongoing successful iron-ore industry,” the Minister said. Contracts valued at A$1.83-billion were awarded to Australian businesses during the project's development, including 290 Western Australian businesses and A$150-million worth of contracts to Aboriginal businesses and their joint venture partners.
