The 420-km railway linking ArcelorMittal Mont-Wright mine to its facilities in Port-Cartier, in Quebec, remains a strategic link, shipping more than 25-million tonnes of iron-ore to international markets. Celebrating the sixtieth anniversary of the railway on Thursday, ArcelorMittal Infrastructure Canada chairperson of the management committee Mapi Mobwano said that the railway was essential to the economic vitality of Quebec’s North Shore region. "Our railway is at the heart of our company's rich history in Québec. It is an integral part of the province's heritage and we are proud of how far we have come in the last 60 years,” he said. The ArcelorMittal railway is 420 km long. It includes 50% curves, 20 bridges, five tunnels and 19 sidings. Nowadays, a train consists of 210 wagons and is more than 2 km long, requiring the use of three locomotives. About 75 000 t of iron-ore is transported on a single rail line every day.
