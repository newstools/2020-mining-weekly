The US Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works (EPW) has approved the bipartisan Bill that includes a yearly programme for a national strategic uranium reserve. EPW Senate committee chairperson Senator John Barrasso stated on Thursday that the American Nuclear Infrastructure Act would promote US international leadership, preserve America's nuclear fuel supply chain, prevent more carbon emissions from entering the atmosphere, and protect economic, energy and national security. "The bipartisan Nuclear Infrastructure Act is broad reaching legislation, important for supporting the US nuclear fuel industry, national security and clean energy. The legislation will provide a clear path for implementation of the US uranium reserve and provide a strong platform to revitalise the US uranium industry,” commented uranium exploration and developer Uranium Energy Corp (UEC) CEO and president Amir Adnani. UEC owns fully licensed and low-cost in-situ recovery projects in Texas and Wyoming. Section 402 of the ANIA specifies that not later than 60 days after the date of enactment, the Secretary of Energy, subject to the availability of appropriations, shall establish a programme to operate a uranium reserve with the authority outlined in the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. Among other provisions, under the Act, the US Department of Energy may only acquire uranium recovered from facilities that are licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission or agreed equivalent State agencies as of the date of enactment. Uranium from companies owned, controlled or subject to jurisdictions in the Russian Federation or the People's Republic of China are excluded from participating in the uranium reserve programme.
