PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Junior explorer Tempus Resources will start trading on the TSX-V on December 7, under the symbol TMRR. “Listing on the TSX-V exchange is a key part of our strategy to further open up investment in the company and access capital from North America, in particular,” said MD Brendan Borg on Friday. “With Americas-focused gold projects, and a strong board and management presence in Canada, this new listing is a logical step, and we look forward to the commencement of trading.” The company on Friday told shareholders that it would retain its primary listing on the ASX.

Tempus’ current focus is on its Blackdome-Elizabeth gold project, in British Columbia, some 200 km from Vancouver. The Elizabeth deposit is estimated to host some 206 139 oz of gold, while Blackdome, some 30 km away, is estimated to host a further 25 900 oz of gold and 54 400 oz of silver.
