Tanzanian President John Magufuli reappointed Doto Biteko as his mining minister in cabinet postings following his re-election in October. Medard Kalemani retained his role of energy minister, State House Chief Secretary John Kijazi announced on the State’s Tanzania Broadcasting Corp on Saturday. Magufuli, who won a second five-year term, left several key ministerial posts unchanged. Last month, he reappointed Philip Mpango as finance chief and Palamagamba Kabudi continued as foreign minister. Tanzania is Africa’s fourth-largest gold producer, with miners including Barrick Gold Corp operating there. The East African country also has an estimated 57.5-trillion cubic feet of natural gas reserves.
