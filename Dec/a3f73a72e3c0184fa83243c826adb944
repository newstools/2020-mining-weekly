Exploration and development company Orefinders says its American Eagle Gold (AEG) spin-out will list on the TSX-V in the first quarter of 2021. AEG will conduct a financing, which will close concurrently with its listing on the exchange. The spin-out will focus on exploring the Golden Trend property, in the Cortez trend in Nevada. The trend is situated adjacent to the Goldrush deposit, which belongs to gold majors Barrick and Newmontâ€™s Nevada Gold Mines. Golden Trend spans 925 ha and shares similar geology to the Goldrush deposit; however, it has seen limited exploration to date and is therefore considered an early exploration stage opportunity, says Orefinders. Orefinders is focused exclusively within the Abitibi greenstone belt.
