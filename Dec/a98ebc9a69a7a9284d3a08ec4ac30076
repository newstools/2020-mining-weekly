Toronto-listed Roxgold has started early works at its Séguéla project, in Côte d’Ivoire, following the approval of a mining permit to develop and operate the gold mine. In anticipation of a positive development decision, the company has broken ground at Séguéla to optimise the project critical path activities and expedite production. Initial works include upgrading the site access road, construction of the accommodation village, and front-end engineering of the processing plant. The intention of the early works activities is to enable a rapid ramp up to full construction next year with the aim of production commencing in 2022. Roxgold will complete a feasibility study for Séguéla in the first half of 2021. “It has been an exceptional year in progressing Séguéla having grown the total mineral resources to over a million ounces, announcing maiden resources at Koula, Ancien, Agouti and Boulder, completing a preliminary economic assessment, and culminating in the environmental and exploitation permit approvals. We thank the government of Côte d’Ivoire for its demonstrated support and commitment to fostering a positive investment climate and we look forward to a lasting and mutually beneficial partnership,” comments CEO John Dorward. The final permitting milestone at Séguéla is the completion of the mining convention negotiation process. Discussions with the government of Côte d’Ivoire are ongoing.
