The Gahcho Kué diamond mine in Canada’s Northwest Territories has delivered its largest-ever diamond– a 157.4 ct gem of exceptional quality, offering a morale boost for operator Mountain Province in a year that has been tough for diamond miners. The recovery shows that the mine, although a high-volume producer of predominantly smaller diamonds, does have the ability to produce diamonds of exceptional size and quality, said CEO Stuart Brown. Mountain Province also reported a strong fourth-quarter sales performance with 956 348 ct sold for C$80.2-million, resulting in an average value of C$83.82 a carat. "The diamond industry has faced immense challenges during 2020 so to end the year with such a strong sales performance is very encouraging. Rough diamond prices, in the larger and better-qualities have been exceptional and pleasingly we saw further improvement in the smaller and lower quality diamonds which we believe will continue to strengthen in 2021,” said Brown. “We look forward to building on this positive momentum in the New Year and put what has been a difficult 2020 behind us as the world starts the road to recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic." Mountain Province owns the Gahcho Kué mine in a joint venture with global major De Beers.
