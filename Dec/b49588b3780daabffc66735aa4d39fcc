PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The government of Greenland has granted junior Ironbark Zinc an exploitation and closure permit for its Citronen zinc/lead project. MD Michael Jardine said on Monday that the grant of the Section 19-43 permit was important on several levels. “It removes the final permitting based impediment to an investment decision in 2021, with only the post final investment decision Section 86 approval yet to be granted. It will greatly assist with the project financing challenges as our partners at EXIM Bank, along with most commercial debt providers, typically do not take permitting risk on projects. “And finally, it puts further distance between Ironbark and its in-country peers with respect to establishing Greenland’s first large-scale mining operation.” The permit approval ends a nine-year-long permitting process. A recent review of the mine plant at Citronen confirmed a 3.3-million-tonne-a-year operation as the optimum scale of the project, with the initial mine life confirmed at 14 years.
