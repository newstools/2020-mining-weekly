SANTIAGO – A workers union at Antofagasta´s Centinela copper mine in Chile agreed on a labour agreement with the Chilean miner, a union leader said on Tuesday, averting the threat of a strike. The agreement followed the company's offer of a 36-month contract, a 2% salary increase and contract-signing bonus of $23 500 per worker. It came after the expiry of two weeks of government-assisted mediation after the Distrito Centinela union, with about 200 members, rejected previous offers. An early contract offer by the company to Centinela's larger Esperanza union was accepted last week. Centinela produced 276 600 t of copper in 2019
