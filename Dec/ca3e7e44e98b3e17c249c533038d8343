PERTH (miningweekly.com) â€“ Mining operations will resume at the Big Bell underground mine, in Western Australia, following a fatal accident earlier this week. ASX-listed Westgold Resources on Thursday said that following the completion of a preliminary investigation, inspectors from the Department of Mines, Industry Regulation and Safety, has cleared the site to resume operations. Westgold is working with the department to finalise the investigation, with the resolution likely to take some time, the company told shareholders. Given the distress caused by the incident, Westgold and its mining services provider Minterra have taken the decision to gradually return to regular operational activities, allowing employees and staff time to receive counseling before returning to work. Operations are expected to progressively return to normal over the coming weeks.
