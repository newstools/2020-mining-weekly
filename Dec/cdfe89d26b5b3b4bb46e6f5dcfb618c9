Diversified miner Glencore has entered into an agreement with commercial services provider Tre-Altamira to expand satellite monitoring to more than 110 of its tailings dams worldwide, which Glencore says is the largest industry monitoring agreement to date specifically focusing on tailings storage monitoring. The monitoring provides measurements of surface movements every 11 days, which is the current maximum available frequency for this type of data collection. By taking measurements from both ascending and descending satellite orbit directions, Glencore will be able to resolve any measured movement on its tailings storage facilities (TSFs) into both horizontal and vertical components. The typical resolution on the ground is 3 m x 3 m with detectable movement resolution in the order of a few millimetres. Measurement data will be provided through a cloud-based platform to ensure the continuous provision of information. Results of the monitoring will also be used to support stakeholder engagement and demonstrate the ongoing safe performance of Glencore's dams. While the main focus of the satellite monitoring programme will be TSFs, the data will also be used at some sites to supplement other terrestrial monitoring techniques, including openpits, waste piles and areas prone to subsidence.
