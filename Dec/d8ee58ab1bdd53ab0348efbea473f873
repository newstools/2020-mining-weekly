Bullion miner Nordgold has successfully increased the processing capacity of its Taborny mine, in Yakutia by 50%, the company announced on Thursday. The capacity was increased from 5-million tonnes a year to 7.5-million tonnes a year. A two-line Metso crusher and telescopic conveyor have been installed as part of the expansion initiative. A pumping station has also been built at the mine’s heap leaching site, comprising four Sulzer pumps, each with a capacity of 400 m3/h. To ensure processing capacity can meet the corresponding increase in mining activity, Taborny has bought two additional hauling trucks, an excavator, a grader, two Epiroc drilling rigs and a number of auxiliary vehicles, including buses, fuel trucks, mobile repair units, a crane truck and a front loader. Congratulating the Taborny team on their success, CEO Nikolai Zelenski said: "Completing a project of this scale on time despite the challenges presented by the pandemic is a testament to their skill and hard work. Increasing Taborny’s production capacity and investing in further technology is vital to maintain a stable production output.” Taborny is an openpit mine, which was opened in 2002. The mine produced more than 76 000 oz last year.
