ASX- and JSE-listed Resource Generation (Resgen) has finalised the legal documentation related to an in-principle financial support agreement with lender Noble Group. Noble last month agreed to provide up to an additional $920 000 in funding to Resgen operating subsidiary Ledjadja Coal. The funding, payable in three instalments, will cover an austerity operating budget for Ledjadja up to February 28, 2021. The funding has also enabled Resgen to progress a strategic review of alternatives for ensuring the continued financial health of the group, along with development of the Boikarabelo project. "The company is appreciative of the continued financial support from Noble," Resgen noted in a December 14 statement.
