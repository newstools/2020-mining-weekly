The Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU) has lamented another two mine fatalities, one at Sibanye-Stillwater’s Rowland shaft, in the North West, and another at the Blyvoor gold mine, on the West Rand. In an emailed response to Mining Weekly, Sibanye confirmed that an employee was fatally injured. “This is tragic and obviously not acceptable, and we are investigating the incident together with the regulators and other stakeholders,” the miner said. It also confirmed that it would “implement any remedial action required” once the investigation had been concluded. In a separate incident, a mineworker has been killed after falling through a sub-shaft at the Blyvoor gold mine, on the West Rand. AMCU said early reports indicate that a cement platform leading into the cage (mining shaft elevator) failed, resulting in the worker falling into the shaft itself. The latest figures from the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy indicate that provisional fatalities in the South African mining industry are 56, with injuries at 1 620 year-to-date (as of December 7). These latest fatalities bring the fatality figure to 58, already seven more than the final figure of 51 fatalities in 2019.
