Mining consultant Minxcon has produced an updated mineral resource statement for the Blyvoor gold tailings project. The laboratory results from a recent drilling programme were integrated with previous drilling results by Minxcon to produce the updated mineral resource statement. The recent drilling had focussed on Blyvoor tailings storage facility (TSF) 6 and 7 and the results of this drilling were combined with previous drill results from the other tailings facilities, namely Blyvoor TSF 1 and Doornfontein TSF 1, 2 and 3 to produce the updated mineral resource. The Blyvoor TSF 6 and 7 measured resource has increased by 109% to 49-million tonnes, while the combined measured and indicated resource has increased by 216% to 84.3-million tonnes. "The technical development of the Blyvoor project, supporting the rapidly advancing funding process, has now reached the critical final stages where new and historical work is integrated and optimised. "The preliminary resource update results have exceeded expectations with an about 10% increase in the total resource, but most importantly, with a 62% component of the total Blyvoor project resource, including all the TSFs now in the measured and indicated category. "A further extremely positive indicator is the expected future conversion of about 90 to 94% of the total diluted resource for TSF 6 and 7 to a potential proven and probable reserve," Aim-listed Katoro Gold CEO Louis Coetzee highlights. Katoro holds a 50% participating interest in the Blyvoor gold tailings project.
