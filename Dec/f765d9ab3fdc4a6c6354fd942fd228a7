Wyoming-based rare earths explorer Arcadia Minerals has asked EnerCom to assist in identifying potential joint venture (JV) partners or buyers for its properties. Arcadia owns two proven resource blocks on 1 133 ha located in Wyoming, containing zirconium, titanium and rare earths. The company says the de-risked opportunity includes “double staked” claims with no legacy title or mining issues, located in a mining-friendly state, and independent engineering reports confirming the contained resources and grade, including metallurgical reports and a prefeasibility report. Arcadia adds that the Wyoming property is viable for openpit mining, with more than 33-million delineated tons that can be dry, wet or magnetically separated. This potential low-cost production project has a potential yield of between 85% and 92%. A recent valuation of the in-situ resource is estimated at $860-million. Critical and rare earth minerals are on a steep upward demand trajectory, with its most prominent uses being in currently high growth markets such as military weaponry, electric vehicles, high-tech digital technologies, renewable energy, electronics and smartphones. Aracadia president Hal Herron says in a news release that it is time to proceed with the development of these valuable resource blocks for the company, for the state and the nation. “Many companies are spending huge sums of exploration dollars looking for the resources that Arcadia already discovered and proved up. The consulting team at EnerCom has opened our eyes to the vast number of potential JV partners that are seeking a critical and rare earth mineral project, including traditional oil and gas minerals companies, coal producers, and international mining companies looking to secure US domestic resources to assure access to the growing demand market.”
