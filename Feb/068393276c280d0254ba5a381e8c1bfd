Synthetic diamond producer Element Six, part of De Beers Group, has welcomed the successful conclusion of its patent infringement lawsuit against a Singaporean diamond producer. The High Court of Singapore found that the Singaporean diamond producer had infringed an Element Six patent for proprietary synthetic diamond products and their methods of manufacture. The patent relates to the production of material that is desirable for use in lab-grown diamond jewellery and in optical applications, such as infrared spectroscopy and laser optics. A secondary Element Six patent, relating to the treatment of CVD synthetic diamonds, was not found to be valid in Singapore and Element Six was considering its legal options with regard to this decision. “The [court’s] decision confirms the validity of our patent for the production of CVD synthetic diamonds, and we hold similar patents in many jurisdictions. We will continue to be vigilant for any other potential infringement of our intellectual property rights around the world,” said Element Six CE Walter Hühn.
