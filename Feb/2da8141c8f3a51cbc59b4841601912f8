Technology creates the opportunity to unlock the value of the African continent, Resolute Mining CEO John Welborn, told delegates at the 2020 Investing in African Mining Indaba, in Cape Town, this week. He highlighted to the audience not only the environmental benefits of a new solar hybrid energy plant being built at its Syama mine, in Mali, but also the significant cost savings that the gold miner expects to achieve. Further, Resolute technical services and automation manager Mohamed Cisse further outlined the benefits of having had the opportunity to design the Syama underground mine to be an automated mine from the start.
