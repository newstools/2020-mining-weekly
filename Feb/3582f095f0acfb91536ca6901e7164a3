Canadian mining company Ivanhoe Mines co-chairperson Robert Friedland this week told delegates at the Investing in African Mining Indaba that the world was shifting towards zero emissions transportation and that this will likely result in shortages of 'green' metals, like platinum and copper. He pointed out that global automotive manufacturers were investing $300-billion in electric vehicles (EVs) as the world moves away from internal combustion engines. The batteries needed to power EVs, however, requires nickel, copper and cobalt, of which Africa is a significant producer. Further, he stated that the development of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles was also picking up pace across the world and that such vehicles are "super platinum and copper" intensive. South Africa, in particular, is important for the global production of platinum used in manufacturing these vehicles.
