PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Oil and gas major Shell has started the construction of a 120 MW solar farm that would supply electricity to the QGC gas venture, in Queensland. The solar farm will connect to the national electricity market grid and would generate enough clean energy to power 50 000 homes, said Queensland Energy Minister Dr Anthony Lynham. He said the solar farm would generate clean energy for QGC’s natural gas processing plants, showing how gas as a transition fuel and clean energy assets can coexist. “With Shell sanctioning this 400 000 panel solar farm it will become part of Queensland’s clean energy revolution, which is providing the world a practical template on how to transition to a low emissions future,” Lynham said. “The Darling Downs and South West Queensland is literally an energy powerhouse, these regions have developed the unprecedented large scale A$70-billion onshore gas industry from a standing start, now hosting some of largest clean energy generators in the country.” Shell Australia chairperson Tony Nunan said solar will play an increasing role in the global energy system, especially when partnered with a reliable energy source such as gas. “This is Shell’s first global investment in an industrial-scale solar farm, and we are proud to be investing in the ‘Sunshine State’ as a key centre of activity under Shell’s global ambition to expand our integrated power business,” Nunan said. “It will help power the operations of our QGC project and reducing carbon dioxide emissions by around 300 000 t/y. It continues our long-standing commitment to the regional development of Queensland and creating thriving, diverse local economies.”
