Gold/copper explorer Georgian Mining has changed its name to Empire Metals to reflect its growth strategy of investing in and advancing projects in new jurisdictions alongside the development of its current project, Bolnisi, in Georgia. Trading in the company's shares on London’s Aim will start under the new name Empire Metals with effect from 8.00 am on Tuesday 11. Chairperson Neil O’Brien said on Monday that, notwithstanding progress in securing the tenure of two of the primary targets at the Bolnisi joint venture, the company had faced numerous challenges in Georgia over the past 18 months. “As a result, the board has been actively evaluating new assets through which to add value to our portfolio of interests in the near term.” Empire would be diversifying away from a single jurisdiction investment through the addition of projects in new geographies.
