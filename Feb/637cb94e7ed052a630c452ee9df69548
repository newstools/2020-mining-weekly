PERTH (miningweekly.com) – New data by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) has shown that Australia’s minerals, metals and energy exports reached a record new high of A$290-billion in 2019, a 17% increase from the previous record set in 2018. The ABS showed that iron-ore exports reached a record A$97-million during the year, while gold reached a record A$24-billion and copper a record A$10-billion, while coal exports remained high at A$65-billion. The Minerals Council of Australia on Thursday said that the ABS data emphasised the importance of the resources industry to the Australian economy. “Mining provides the economic bedrock for the Australian government to meet its immediate and long-term challenges,” said CEO Tania Constable. “The growth in resources exports benefits all Australians through the considerable taxes and royalties the industry pays – funding the teachers, nurses, police and infrastructure projects on which all Australians rely.”
