JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) – Development of the world’s largest hydrogen-powered mine truck took another step forward this week. Autocar reports that Anglo American has engaged Williams Advanced Engineering to help develop the new fuel cell electric vehicle that will be put through its paces at South Africa’s Mogalakwena platinum group metals (PGM) mine in Limpopo. Autocar quotes Anglo American technology development head Julian Soles as saying the company is looking forward to working with Williams Advanced Engineering to deliver the technology step-change that has the potential to boost PGMs demand. Anglo American Platinum CEO Chris Griffith told last week’s Investing in African Mining Indaba in Cape Town that PGMs are earmarked to unlock the versatility of green hydrogen in both stationary power generation and transport, where hydrogen can be used with PGMs in fuel cells. PGM catalysts in electrolysers can produce hydrogen from renewable energy sources that can be stored indefinitely as an on-demand energy source and PGM catalysts in different types of fuel cells, including proton exchange membrane fuel cells used in vehicle mobility applications to convert hydrogen back into electricity. “We’re starting to see real traction taking place right across the globe,” Griffith said. Eighteen countries now have detailed strategies for the deployment of hydrogen energy solutions. Autocar reports that Williams Advanced Engineering will design and build the power units in Grove, Oxfordshire, UK, for integration into an existing mining haul truck.
