Russian miner Alrosa will hold four auctions in New York this year for rough diamonds weighing more than 10.8 ct. “In general, each auction attracts up to 100 companies from different countries. Auction sales currently account for about 10% of our overall sales,” Alrosa deputy CEO Evgeny Agureev commented in a statement on Friday. The first auction in New York will be held from February 18 to 28, with results to be announced at the beginning of March. Further auctions are scheduled to start on May 11, July 20 and November 16. Alrosa’s overall rough and polished diamond sales from January to December 2019 amounted to $3.34-billion, with rough diamonds accounting for $3.27-billion and polished diamonds for $64.7-million.
