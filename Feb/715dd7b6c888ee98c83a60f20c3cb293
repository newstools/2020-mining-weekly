JSE-listed Merafe Resources expects to report a basic loss a share of between 52.9c and 58.3c for the year ended December 31. The company also anticipates a headline loss a share of between 2.3c and 2.9c for the year, compared with headline earnings a share of 27.2c for the year ended December 31, 2018. Merafe attributed the decrease in headline earnings to lower ferrochrome and chrome ore prices, which were partially offset by a stronger average rand:dollar exchange rate. Additionally, the decrease in earnings a share was owing to an impairment of property, plant and equipment. The trigger for the impairment assessment was Merafeâ€™s share price, which was trading at a discount to its net asset value. The impairment loss was a result of the calculated recoverable amount being lower than the net carrying amount of the business. The company will release its full results on March 9.
