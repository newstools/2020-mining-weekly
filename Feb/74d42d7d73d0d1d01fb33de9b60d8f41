The takeover of TSX-listed Continental Gold by China’s Zijin Mining Group is expected to close in the next ten days, after the companies gained the final regulatory approvals for the C$1.3-billion transaction. Zijin has received the Canadian Investment Canada Act approval, as well as all three of the required regulatory approvals from China. Through the deal, State-backed Zijin is securing Continental’s flagship Buritica gold project, in Colombia. Following closing of the transaction, Continental’s common shares will be delisted from the TSX.
