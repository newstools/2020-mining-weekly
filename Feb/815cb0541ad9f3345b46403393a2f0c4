JSE- and NYSE-listed Harmony Gold revealed its headline earnings per share (HEPS) and earnings per share (EPS) for the six months ended December 31, to be 249c, or 6 325%, higher year-on-year. In dollar terms, HEPS and EPS are expected to be $0.17 a share, compared with $0.00 for the six months ended December 31, 2018. The higher earnings come on the back of the miner’s revenue having increased by R1.7-billion, or 12%, year-on-year mainly as a result of the higher gold price received. The average gold price received for the six months increased by 19% to R683 158/kg. Net profit for the half-year period is expected to be R1.3-billion, or 7 111%, higher year-on-year. Total gold production in the first half of the 2020 financial year, in comparison to the prior comparable period, was 8% lower at 21 411 kg, or 688 370 oz, largely owing to a 6% reduction in underground recovered grade to 5.29 g/t. The decrease, Harmony said on Thursday, was attributable mainly to grade issues at Kusasalethu and Target. All-in sustaining costs for all operations were 15% higher year-on-year at R605 911/kg owing to lower production. Harmony will publish its interim results on February 11.
