JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) – Gold mining company Gold Fields, which has declared a final dividend of 100c a share, recorded 2019 production which exceeded guidance, along with lower costs and an increased dividend. Attributable 2019 gold equivalent production was 2 195 000 oz, an 8% increase, and all-in costs fell 9% to $1 064/oz. All-in sustaining costs (AISC) on the original World Gold Council interpretation were $970/oz and $897/oz on the revised interpretation. AISC guidance for the year was between $980/oz and $995/oz. Headline earnings for 2019 were $163-million, or $0.20 a share (2018: $0.07 a share) and normalised profit for the year was $343-million, a more than a twelve-fold increase year-on-year. In line with the Johannesburg- and New York-listed company’s dividend policy of paying out 25% to 35% of normalised earnings as dividends, Gold Fields declared a final dividend of 100 SA cents a share taking the total dividend for the year to 160 SA cents a share (2018: 40 SA cents a share). Strong operational performance, an increase in the gold price and lower project capital expenditure drove a significant swing in net cash flow, with $249-million generated during 2019, compared with an outflow of $122-million in 2018. Mine cash flow for the year, which excludes project capital, was $552-million, compared with $345-million in 2018. Gold Fields CEO Nick Holland said in a release to Mining Weekly that the company was entering a period of strong operational cash flow, with 2019 marking the end of the company’s  reinvestment programme, which started in the latter part of 2016.
