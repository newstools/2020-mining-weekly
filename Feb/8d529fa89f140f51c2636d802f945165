PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Ian Purdy has been appointed as the new CEO for uranium company Paladin Energy, starting on February 4. Purdy was previously the CFO of oil and gas producer Quadrant Energy, assisting in transforming the company from a branch office of a large multi-national oil and gas company into a full stand-alone ASX-100 equivalent company. Prior to his position at Quadrant, Purdy was the MD of Mirabela Nickel, leading the company through the construction and production of its operation in Brazil. “The board is very pleased that Purdy has agreed to join the company as CEO. We extend our sincere thanks to the top quality candidates who expressed interest in the CEO role and participated in the selection process; this is a testament to the outstanding position the company is in within the uranium market,” said Paladin chairperson Cliff Lawrenson. “Purdy has the necessary experience and skill set to optimise Paladin’s exiting assets, improve the company’s strategic position within the nuclear fuel market, maximise Paladin’s strategic options and work comfortably and confidently with our shareholders and the wider investment community.” Outgoing CEO Scott Sullivan will remain with the company through to July this year, and will work with Purdy on his transition into the CEO role.
