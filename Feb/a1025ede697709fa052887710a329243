JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) – Gold mining company Barrick Gold Corporation on Wednesday announced a 40% increase in dividend as its gold production for 2019 of 5 465 000 oz was at the top end of its guidance range. Announcing its results for the fourth quarter and the year, the New York and Toronto-listed company, headed by Dr Mark Bristow, reported net earnings per share of $2.26 for the year and noted that its adjusted net earnings per share were up 46% year-on-year while debt net of cash was halved from 2018 to $2.2-billion. The 40%-higher quarterly dividend was $0.07c a share, justified by the significant reduction in net debt and strong balance sheet. At the time of the Barrick-Randgold Resources merger, the third-quarter 2018 dividend was 3c a share, which was increased to 4c for the first quarter of 2019, then 5c for the third quarter of last year, and is now 7c a share.
