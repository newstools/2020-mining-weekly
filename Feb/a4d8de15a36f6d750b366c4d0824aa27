PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The Chilean government’s Central Environmental Committee has voted to approve the Maricunga lithium project, in the Atacama region. ASX-listed Lithium Power International on Wednesday said that its joint venture company Minera Salar Blanco had received environmental approval, allowing for the development of the $563-million project, with an anticipated production rate of 20 000 t/y. “Receiving this regulatory approval is the final milestone in advancing our Maricunga project and reinforces our continued strong relationship with the Chilean government. We are confident that the subsequent commencement of the construction will generate a positive impact both for the local communities and the country,” said Lithium Power International CEO Cristobal Garcia-Hudobro. “Discussions with a number of international financial institutions and potential offtakers are underway and will now be sped-up to acquire the necessary funding for the construction.” Construction is expected to start by the end of the third quarter this year.
