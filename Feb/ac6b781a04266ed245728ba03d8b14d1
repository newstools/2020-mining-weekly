PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Australian Bauxite subsidiary Alcore has appointed engineering firm Clough Projects Australia to provide the engineering for the design and construction of its planned bauxite refining plant. “Clough is an ideal engineer for Alcore’s transition from lab research stage to its first commercial plant. Clough’s long-term association with this technology augers well for good teamwork,” said Alcore COO Phillip Hall. Alcore has global exclusive rights to the aluminium-relation portion of CORE Technology, and after six months of testwork has committed to the best strategy for its first commercial plant whereby by-products from aluminium smelters will be converted into aluminium fluoride, which can be sold back to the smelters as an essential electrolyte for smelting. Alcore said that the strategy has the highest and fastest growth potential world-wide, as plants could be replicated adjacent to aluminium smelters throughout the western world allowing for higher environmental credits for the recycling of by-products, reduction of emissions, lowering costs and reducing the dependency on imported aluminium fluoride. ALcore can refine two smelter by-products, one of which is  high aluminium and the second with high fluorine, so that all aluminium fluoride components are freely available.
