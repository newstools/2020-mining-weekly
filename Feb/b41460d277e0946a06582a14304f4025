PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Junior Ora Banda Mining has reported a 190% increase in the resource at its Waihi prospect, which forms part of the Davyhurst gold project, in Western Australia. The mineral resource estimate at Waihi has now increased from 71 000 oz to 206 000 oz, while the total mineral resource estimate at Davyhurst has increased to 1.99-million ounces. “This very robust resource increase for Waihi is an excellent platform on which the development of viable mining operations at Waihi can confidently be planned. Our long-held view that Waihi would be a key component in startup phase of the larger Davyhurst gold project has been significantly enhanced by this result,” said Ora Banda MD David Quinlivan. A detailed mine design for the Waihi deposit is now in progress.
