An appeal hearing against the integrated water-use licence (Iwul) granted to Aim-listed emerging phosphate producer Kropzâ€™s Elandsfontein project, in the Western Cape, resumed on Thursday. The appeal hearing by the Water Tribunal started in December 2019 and a continuance was granted to resume hearings this week. To allow the tribunal the appropriate opportunity to fully review the matter, Kropz said it would not comment further on the official proceedings until the tribunal has announced its decision. Three days have been scheduled for the hearing. The timing of the decision is currently unknown. Pending the tribunal's decision, there is no legal impediment to the continuation of the water-use activities authorised in the Iwul, Kropz stated.
