Diamond miner Lucara Diamond Corporation has recovered an unbroken 549 ct white diamond "of exceptional purity" from its Karowe mine, in Botswana. The diamond was recovered from direct milling of ore sourced from the EM/PK(S) unit of the South Lobe. This follows the recent recovery of a gem-quality 176 ct diamond from the same ore block. The EM/PK(S) continues to produce large gem-quality diamonds in line with expectations and forms an important economic driver for the potential underground mine at Karowe. The EM/PK(S) has also delivered other high-value diamonds including the 1 758 ct Sewelô, the 1 109 ct Lesedi La Rona and the 813 ct Constellation diamond. The 549 ct diamond was recovered in the Mega Diamond Recovery (MDR) X-ray transmission circuit that allows for diamond recovery post primary crushing and prior to milling. The diamond is the second diamond recovered from the MDR, which was commissioned in 2017. "Lucara is extremely pleased to be starting off 2020 with the recovery of two large, high-quality diamonds that builds on the positive momentum generated following the completion of a strong fourth-quarter sale in December and the announcement of our ground breaking partnership with Louis Vuitton on the Sewelô in January. "The unbroken 549 ct diamond is the fourth-largest diamond recovered at Karowe and the first large gem to be recovered through the MDR. We look forward to continued success at Karowe and an exciting 2020," commented Lucara CEO Eira Thomas.
