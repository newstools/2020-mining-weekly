PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Copper/gold miner Oz Minerals on Friday confirmed that the prefeasibility study (PFS) on the West Musgrave project was continuing, with the miner acknowledging speculation around the project. Oz Minerals and its joint venture partner Cassini Resources in August last year extended the timeline for the PFS to allow for a detailed evaluation of a range of potential value add opportunities. “Extending the timeline of activities also allows for a greater level of in-fill drilling than was contemplated in our original prefeasibility study timeline, which will provide a clearer view of the project economics and key value drivers when the prefeasibility study is completed early next year,” Oz Minerals chief commercial officer Mark Irwin said at the time.

The PFS is based on a ten-million-tonne-a-year operation, and would look at increasing the mine life from the eight years considered in the scoping study, to beyond 15 years. Oz Minerals on Friday said that the PFS will be supported by a mineral resource and ore reserve statement, neither of which was complete. Furthermore, the review and approval of the PFS and the progression to a feasibility study would require consideration by the Oz Minerals board.
