PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed West African Resources has completed the commissioning of the primary crusher at its Sanbrado gold project, in Burkina Faso, ahead of schedule. First gold production has now been brought forward, and is expected early in the second quarter of 2020, instead of the third quarter, as previously scheduled. “We are very pleased to have crushed the first M5 openpit ore ahead of schedule at Sanbrado. The overall construction project is tracking ahead of schedule, which is a credit to the skills and experience of West African Resources’ team and the quality and cooperation of the contractors and consultants working with us on the build,” said executive chairperson Richard Hyde. “Double shift openpit mining has recently started with over 200 000 t of oxide ore now on the run-of-mine pad. Commissioning activities are also progressing well, with the project now tracking towards an early second quarter maiden gold pour.” Meanwhile, underground development is also continuing to progress to schedule, and first development ore is on track for late March, while the first stoping ore is forecast for the third quarter of this year. The $185-million Sanbrado project is currently expected to produce an average of 211 000 oz/y of gold over the first five years of operation, with production averaging 133 000 oz/y over the 11-year life-of-mine.
