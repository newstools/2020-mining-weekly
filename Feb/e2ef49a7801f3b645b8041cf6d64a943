The Minerals Council South Africa is no longer just the voice of the mining majors, Grant Mitchell, who heads up the council's Junior and Emerging Miners Desk, pointed out in a briefing at the 2020 Investing in African Mining Indaba, this week. He highlighted that 40% of the Minerals Council's members were junior miners. He also noted that South Africa's junior mining sector is often compared with that of other mining jurisdictions, like Canada, and that it is often considered to not be as advanced. However, he stressed that South Africa's junior mining sector has come a long way in the last 20 years.
