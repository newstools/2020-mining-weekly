Canadian gold miner Iamgold has published an updated mineral resource estimate for the Pitangui project – a grassroots discovery made by the company’s Brazilian exploration team. The updated resource estimate, based on an underground mining scenario, comprises an indicated resource of 3.33-million tonnes grading 4.39 g/t gold for 0.47-million contained ounces and an inferred resource of 3.56-million tonnes grading 3.78 g/t for 0.43-million contained ounces, at a cut-off grade of 2.5 g/t. The updated estimate has converted 52% of the resources to an indicated category relative to the previously stated mineral resources of February 2019.
