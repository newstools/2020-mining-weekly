North America-based Kore Mining has started preparations of a preliminary economic assessment (PEA) of its 100%-owned Imperial oxide gold deposit in California, the results of which are expected early in the second quarter. The engineering work completed for the PEA will also be used to complete a new plan of operations, which is a key document to re-start the permitting process for Imperial. “Imperial is a rare, unmined, at surface oxide gold deposit amenable to simple run-of-mine heap leaching. I have worked closely with and have great confidence in the team Kore has selected to complete Imperial's preliminary economic assessment. Imperial will be engineered to the highest standards with full compliance to California's high standards of environmental regulation and site reclamation,” commented Kore COO Marc Leduc. Kore has engaged multifaceted engineering firm Global Resource Engineering (GRE) to lead development of a PEA of Imperial with heap leach design from Geo-Logic. GRE completed a site visit to formally kick off the PEA project on January 9, and has been working on mine design for the last several months.
