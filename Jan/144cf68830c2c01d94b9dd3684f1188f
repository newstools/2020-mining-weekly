The World Economic Forum (WEF) has asked International Monetary Fund MD Kristalina Georgieva and African Rainbow Minerals chairperson Patrice Motsepe to join its board of trustees. The WEF said in a statement on Friday that both Georgieva and Motsepe have a record of thought leadership and long-term success in their fields, which will strengthen the forum’s platform for public–private cooperation. Georgieva previously served as CEO at the World Bank and interim president of World Bank Group. Motsepe is also the nonexecutive chairperson of Harmony Gold Mining Company, deputy chairperson of Sanlam and founding president of Business Unity South Africa.
