PERTH (miningweekly.com) â€“ Gold miner Blackham Resources on Thursday reported that quarterly production for the three months to December had increased to 20 003 oz, up from the 17 565 oz produced in the previous quarter. The increased production was driven by higher mined grade encountered in transitional and fresh material towards the base of the Wiluna openpit mines, in Western Australia. Gold sales for the quarter were also higher at 20 453 oz, up from the 17 783 oz sold in the September quarter, while gold prices also rose from A$1 882/oz to A$2 072/oz in the same period. Blackham on Thursday maintained its gold production and cost guidance for the full year, of between 70 000 oz and 80 000 oz of gold, at an all-in sustaining cost of between A$1 550/oz and A$1 750/oz.
