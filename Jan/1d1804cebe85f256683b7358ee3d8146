PERTH (miningweekly.com) â€“ Coal miner Stanmore Coal has reported a 23% increase in run-of-mine (RoM) production in the December quarter, compared with the previous quarter, with production increasing 21% in the year-to-date. Stanmore on Tuesday reported that RoM coal production for the December quarter had reached 864 000 t, up from the 704 000 t produced in the September quarter, and up from the 798 000 t produced in the previous corresponding quarter. In the year-to-date, production reached 1.56-million tonnes. Saleable coal production was down by 2% in the quarter, from 619 000 t to 609 000 t, but up in the year-to-date, from 977 000 t to 1.22-million tonnes. Meanwhile, coal sales for the December quarter were down 31% on the September quarter, at 497 000 oz, owing to co-shipper coal availability delays, which resulted into shipments being delayed until January. In the year-to-date, coal sales were up by 37%, from 892 000 t to 1.21-million tonnes. With some coal shipments delayed, Stanmore has reported a 165% increase in its coal stockpiles, and a 286% increase in its ROM coal stockpiles, which stood at 179 000 t and 96 000 t respectively at the end of the quarter. Looking ahead, the ASX-listed miner has maintained its full year saleable coal production guidance of 2.35-million tonnes for the full year, with all-in sustaining costs expected to reach A$107/t, excluding royalty.
