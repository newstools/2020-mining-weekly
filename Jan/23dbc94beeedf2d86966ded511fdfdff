The Public Enterprises Ministry said on Wednesday that Malegapuru William Makgoba had been appointed interim chairperson of struggling State-owned power utility Eskom, after the resignation of Jabu Mabuza last week. Makgoba is a scientist and academic who joined the Eskom board as a non-executive director in 2018, the ministry said in a statement, adding that the government was "going through the process of putting in place a reconfigured board". Mabuza resigned after failing to prevent power cuts over Christmas and New Year.
