ASX-listed Manas Resources has been granted a new 347 km2 exploration licence around its Mbengué gold project, in Côte d'Ivoire. This increases the total project area to 647 km2. The project is located in the highly prospective Senoufo greenstone belt, near some of the region’s largest mines. It lies 6 km north of TSX-listed Barrick Gold’s Tongon mine and 40 km southeast of ASX-listed Resolute Mining’s Syama mine. During prior exploration studies, Manas had conducted soil geochemistry, geophysical surveys and drilling campaigns, which identified numerous bedrock gold occurrences – most notably the 9-km-long Madala-Turaco target. Manas on Wednesday said the new licence area contains the continuation of geochemical and geochemical anomalies on the existing licence area, including the 12 km strike length Mbengué Shear Zone and the 25 km strike length Tongon Shear Zone. “We were delighted to have increased the size of the project in Côte d’Ivoire. Manas had been systematically exploring at Mbengué and our activities had already identified a number of major structures with potential to host significant gold deposits. “The company had been diligently trying to expand its footprint in the area during the course of last year. The newly expanded project area was well located, close to existing mine infrastructure in an underexplored portion of the highly-prospective Senoufo greenstone belt,” said Manas chairperson Alan Campbell. He added that, with a strong cash position and low burn rate, Manas was ideally placed to take advantage of any exploration success as its activities progress this year.
