The Gunnison copper project, in southern Arizona, is performing better than planned, with the initial copper recovery grades exceeding feasibility study expectations, TSX- and FSE-listed Excelsior Mining reported on Wednesday. Pregnant leach solution grade is currently measuring 0.15 g/ℓ copper in the primary recovery pond – a milestone that Excelsior achieved ahead of schedule and keeps the project on pace for copper production this quarter. "We have the newest, most orderly, and technologically advanced in-situ recovery wellfield on the planet, and to date, it is functioning better than anticipated,” stated president and CEO Stephen Twyerould. Acid injection is being steadily increased and is currently at about 50% of the full production rate. The 41 injection and recovery wells that comprise the production wellfield will continue to circulate mining solutions in a closed-loop system until the concentration of copper held in solution warrants processing. Once this grade is achieved, mining solutions will then be treated through the Johnson Camp processing facilities to extract copper and produce LME grade copper cathode sheets. First copper cathode sales are expected in the first quarter. Excelsior last week started operations at Gunnison, which is permitted to produce 125-million pounds a year. The Environmental Protection Agency recently approved the start of mining operations through the injection of acid. The Gunnison in-situ recovery copper extraction project is permitted to produce 125-million pounds a year of copper cathode. The feasibility study projected an after-tax net present value of $807-million and an internal rate of return of 40%, using a $2.75/lb copper price and a 7.5% discount rate.
