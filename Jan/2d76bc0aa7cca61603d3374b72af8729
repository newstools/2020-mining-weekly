Aim-listed Central Asia Metals (CAML) managed to exceed its yearly guidance at the Kounrad copper recovery plant, in Kazakhstan, producing 13 771 t in 2019. This while production at the Sasa mine, in north Macedonia, reached the top end of the guidance range at 23 360 t zinc and 29 201 t lead. The Kounrad plant produced 14 049 t of copper in 2018, while the Sasa mine’s output was 22 532 t zinc and 29 388 t lead in 2018. The company ended the year off with $32.4-million in cash, while its gross debt stood at $108-million. CEO Nigel Robinson said 2019 had been a productive year at Sasa and that many improvements had been made on site, including installation of a new tertiary crusher, which should aid increased production in 2020. “We intend to transition to cut and fill mining in the next few years, which results in a busy year of technical studies while we finalise plans during 2020,” he confirmed. CAML had set its guidance for this year at between 12 500 t and 13 500 t copper, between 23 000 t and 25 000 t zinc and between 30 000 t and 32 000 t lead.
