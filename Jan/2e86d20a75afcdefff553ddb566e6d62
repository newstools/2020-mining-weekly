RUSTENBURG – Two mine security officers were arrested for their alleged role in a murder, hijacking and attempted robbery at a gold mine, the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (known as the Hawks) said on Wednesday. Spokesperson Captain Tlangelani Rikhotso said the two, aged 31 and 34, were arrested in Setlagole on Monday. "On 20 December 2019, a group of armed robbers allegedly ambushed two mine security officers, held them hostage then took the company vehicles to gain access into the gold plant. The suspects allegedly shot and killed the security officer outside the plant to gain entry," she said. "Once inside, the suspects held employees including the security officers hostage while they drilled the walls and used explosives in an attempt to access the smelting house, however, they failed. The suspects then aborted the mission and fled the scene."
