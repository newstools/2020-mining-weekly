PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Coal hopeful Prairie Mining is awaiting a formal announcement from the Polish government, which could affect the future of its flagship Jan Karski mine. The Polish government at the end of December reportedly awarded Lubelski Weigiel Bogdanka a mining concession for the K6-7 deposit, which forms an integral part of Prairie’s planned Jan Karski mine on the Lublin concession. Prairie at the time said that it was awaiting a formal announcement from the government, and would not comment until a formal legal assessment of the situation had been made. Prairie in February last year formally notified the Polish government of an investment dispute, but the company noted that no amicable resolution had occurred, since the government had declined to participate in substantive discussions related to the dispute. The ASX-listed company said in December that it was working with its legal advisers to prepare submissions and finalise funding arrangements for an international arbitration claim. A 2016 prefeasibility study on the Jan Karski project estimated that the project would produce 176.7-million run-of-mine tonnes over its 24-year mine life, and about 139.1-million tonnes of saleable coal.
