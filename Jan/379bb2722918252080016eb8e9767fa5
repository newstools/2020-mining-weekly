Global gold major Barrick Gold said on Thursday it expects fourth-quarter gold production to be higher than third quarter, benefiting from strong output from its Turquoise Ridge gold mine in Nevada. Total preliminary gold production rose to 1.44-million ounces in the quarter ended December 31, from 1.31-million ounces in the third, while copper output gained 4.5% to 117-million pounds.
