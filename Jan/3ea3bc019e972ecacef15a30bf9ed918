The Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC) has inaugurated a state-of-the-art luxury vault and safe deposit facility, the 818 Vault, in the Jumeirah Lakes Towers (JLT), in Dubai. Officially opened on Wednesday, the high-security vault adds to DMCC’s trade and business ecosystem that provides facilities, services and infrastructure to member companies operating in the gold, diamond, precious metals and jewellery sectors. Welcoming the vault to the Almas Tower, in JLT, further solidifies DMCC’s position as “the nucleus of the gold, diamond and jewellery trade,” DMCC CEO Ahmed Bin Sulayem said. According to Sulayem, the tower’s strategic location, high security and convenient access makes it “the natural choice” for a luxury jewellery vault. The 818 Vault offers the highest levels of security, according to 818 Vault CEO and founder Vikram Jethwani. The vault is equipped with a secure dual-control locking mechanism, while each safety deposit locker has two ten-lever locks that are accessed with two unique key profiles. In addition to safety deposit lockers, the vault offers a range of additional services, including insurance and repair for deposited jewellery. This opening marks the second jewellery vault located at Almas Tower, following the launch of DMCC’s first vault in April 2009.
