Coal miner Peabody on Wednesday named Mark Spurbeck as interim CFO, replacing Amy Schwetz, who will be taking the CFO position at an NYSE-listed industrial company. Schwetz, who has served as CFO for five years, will continue with Peabody in coming weeks to ensure a smooth transition, the company said in a statement. Spurbeck has more than 20 years of accounting and financial experience, most recently serving as chief accounting officer overseeing Peabody's finance, treasury, tax, internal audit, financial reporting and corporate accounting functions. Prior to joining Peabody in early 2018, he was VP of finance and chief accounting officer at Coeur Mining. He also previously held multiple positions at Newmont Mining over an eight-year period.
