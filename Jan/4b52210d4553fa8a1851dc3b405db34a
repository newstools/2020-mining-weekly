The baseline environmental assessment of the Kun-Manie nickel/copper sulphide project, in the far east of Russia, has been filed and approved by government agencies. The baseline environmental assessment has to be included in the TEO, which is the Russian required feasibility study. The completion of the baseline environmental assessment confirmed that the Kun-Manie nickel/copper sulphide deposit would not require any extraordinary programmes or procedures beyond those already planned by the company, CEO Robin Young said on Wednesday. â€œTypical monitoring and mitigation procedures can be implemented to ensure protection of the environment during construction and operations." The BLEA component of the TEO defines the base line preproduction environmental setting and conditions. This is an integral part of the environmental quality management system and the related controls for monitoring the impacts of the planned mining operation at Kun-Manie. Specifically the impacts related to mining, sedimentation, air quality management, emergency procedures, water quality monitoring and management systems establish that there are no extraordinary considerations beyond those of a typical mining operation.
