North American miner Taseko Mines in 2019 produced 126-million pounds of copper and 2.7-million pounds of molybdenum from its 75%-owned Gibraltar mine, in British Columbia. This had met the production guidance that the company set, despite a CN Rail strike in November, which impacted on the mineâ€™s concentrate shipments for 11 days and forced the company to reduce its production, owing to concentrate storage capacity issues. The strike impacted on fourth-quarter production, which was slightly lower than planned at 33.4-million pounds of copper and 700 000 lb of molybdenum. Total sales for the year were 122-million pounds of copper and 2.8-million pounds of molybdenum. "We are pleased to have met the annual production guidance that we provided 12 months ago," said Taseko CEO Russell Hallbaurer. He added in a statement on Thursday that the company had to issue a new form of reclamation security for Gibraltar, which had resulted in $36-million of cash being released to Taseko in the fourth quarter last year. Looking forward, a stronger copper price and lower refining costs should help operating margins improve this year, he said.
