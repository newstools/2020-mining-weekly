DEZIWA MINE, Democratic Republic of Congo – The Democratic Republic of Congo's State mining company Gécamines on Wednesday opened the Deziwa copper and cobalt mine and processing plant, part of a joint venture majority-owned by China Nonferrous Metal Mining Company (CNMC). The Deziwa deposit, around 35 km east of Kolwezi, is estimated to hold 4.6-million tonnes of copper and 420 000 t of cobalt. Somidez, the joint venture controlling it, is held 51% by CNMC and 49% by Gécamines. An $880-million project which started construction in May 2018, the Deziwa mine aims to produce 80 000 t/y of copper and 8 000 t/y of cobalt, according to Somidez. Sliding cobalt prices have hurt Congo's output of the battery material. Glencore decided in August 2019 to close the Mutanda copper and cobalt mine – the world's largest. Mutanda shut on November 25, a month before the mine was set to go into maintenance, due to a lack of sulphuric acid.
