PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Oil and gas major Woodside Petroleum on Friday announced that the joint venture (JV) partners have approved the development of Phase 1 of the Sangomar field development, in Senegal. The government of Senegal earlier this week approved the Rufisque offshore, Sangomar offshore and Sangomar Deep offshore JV exploitation plan, and granted authorisation for the Sangomar field development. The Sangomar development concept is a stand-alone floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) facility with 23 subsea wells and supporting subsea infrastructure, with the facility expected to have a production capacity of 100 000 barrels a day, and would process the oil before it is exported to market via tanks. Phase 1 of the development will target an estimated 231-million barrels of oil equivalent of oil resources from the lower, less complex reservoirs, and an initial pilot phase in the upper reservoirs. First oil is targeted for 2023. Woodside CEO Peter Coleman on Friday said that the Sangomar development was a major pillar of Woodside’s growth strategy with substantial upside from potential future phases. “We look forward to progressing the project towards first oil in early 2023 and expect that our experience in offshore PFSO developments will support its delivery on cost and schedule.

“We are grateful for the ongoing support of the government of Senegal and will be working with all stakeholders to ensure that the country’s first oil project delivers enduring benefits to its people.” The JV consists of Woodside, Capricorn Senegal, and ASX-listed FAR, and Petrosen.
