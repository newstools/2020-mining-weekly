TSX- and NYSE American-listed PolyMet Mining has recruited Richard Lock as senior VP and project director for the NorthMet copper/nickel project, in Minnesota, US. Lock is a veteran mining executive who has led construction and development of large copper and other mines around the globe, most recently the construction of KAZ Minerals’ Peschanka openpit copper mine, in Russia. Previously, he held executive and project director roles at Arizona Mining’s Hermosa project, a lead/zinc/silver mine in southern Arizona, Yara International’s Dallol project, a sulphate of potash mining project in Ethiopia, Western Potash’s Milestone project, a potash solution mining project in Canada and Rio Tinto’s Resolution and Keystone copper projects in Arizona and Utah, respectively. The PolyMet project will be Minnesota’s first copper/nickel/precious metals mine, but it has faced fierce opposition from environmental groups concerned about the proposed mine’s impact on the nearby rivers and lakes. PolyMet plans to develop the NorthMet mining operation in two phases, the first of which involves development of 225-million tons – nearly one-third of project’s known resource – into an operating mine processing 32 000 t/d over a 20-year mine life. It also includes rehabilitating the former LTV Steel Mining Company processing plant. Phase 2 involves construction and operation of a hydrometallurgical plant to treat nickel sulphide concentrates into upgraded nickel/cobalt hydroxide and recover additional copper and platinum-group metals. Meanwhile, PolyMet also reported that Dennis Bartlett had retired from its board of directors, effective December 31, 2019. He joined the board in 2017.
