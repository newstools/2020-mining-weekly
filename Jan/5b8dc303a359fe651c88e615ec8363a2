Aim-listed Ncondezi Energy is on track to submit a tariff financial model for its integrated 300 MW coal-fired power project and coal mine in Tete, Mozambique, to strategic partners at the end of this month. The company is targeting a competitive tariff rate in line with tariff rates recently agreed with Electricidade de Moçambique. The supporting engineering, procurement and construction information has been received and is under review by Ncondezi’s technical team. Moreover, the supporting operations and maintenance information is currently under optimisation process with strategic partners. Target tariff negotiation finalisation is expected during the first half of this year. The Ncondezi project is being designed to provide low-cost, reliable 24-hour power, while meeting the strictest emission standards. It is aligned with the Mozambique government’s strategy for adding baseload power capacity to the grid by 2023 and achieving universal energy access by 2030.
