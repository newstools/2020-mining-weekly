PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Diamond miner Lucapa’s polishing strategy has achieved its first diamonds from a cutting and polishing partnership. The ASX-listed company on Tuesday reported that a 36 ct rough diamond recovered from the Mothae mine, in Lesotho, was manufactured into six polished D-colour diamonds under a partnership with an international diamantaire. The two largest polished diamonds produced were both graded as D-colour and flawless by the Gemological Institute of America, and included an 8.88 ct pear diamond. “The exceptional diamonds manufactured under our first profit-sharing cutting and polishing partnership represent another milestone for Lucapa’s growth as a global diamond group as we progress along the diamond value chain,” said MD Stephen Wetherall. “This strategy was implemented to maximise the rough value of our diamond production from our Mothae and Lulo mines and to access additional revenue streams for Lucapa and our mining partners into the future.”
