TSX-V-listed Giyani Metals will start work on the feasibility study for its K.Hill manganese deposit, in Botswana. The announcement follows after Giyani received positive initial feedback from SRK Consulting, Tetra Tech and Royal IHC following a three-day visit to K.Hill in late December. During the site visit, the team surveyed the K.Hill deposit and the surrounding area to consider potential locations for the mine, processing plant, waste rock and tailings facilities. The team also assessed the area’s infrastructure to develop an initial understanding of the requirements to build and operate the K.Hill project. Additionally, drill hole locations from the 2018 resource drilling programme were inspected and potential drill hole locations for the infill drilling programme for 2020 were considered. Another aspect was any potential benefits and impacts of the K.Hill project on the town of Kanye, which will be examined in detail in the environmental- and social-impact assessment to be run in parallel with the feasibility study. SRK project manager Mike Beare said the site visit was a “quality opportunity to kickstart the study with all team members present”. According to Tetra Tech project director Jacques du Toit and IHC Mining director for engineering, procurement and construction and project delivery Derk Hartman, “the site visit confirmed that Giyani has a unique opportunity to benefit from some of the best infrastructure in Southern Africa”. This includes well-maintained roads and close access to the robust power supply network that also feeds Debswana’s nearby Jwaneng diamond mine, established supply routes and power will enable a fast and cost-efficient development of the project, they added.
