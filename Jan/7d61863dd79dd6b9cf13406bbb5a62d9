Creamer Media is launching a new daily email newsletter – Mining Weekly Global Edition – featuring mining news stories from around the world. Whereas Creamer Media’s other popular mining newsletters focus on mining news from specific regions, the new Mining Weekly Global Edition offers readers a roundup of the major mining stories from Africa, the Americas, Australasia and Europe. Recipients of the Mining Weekly Global Edition can also listen to an audio version of the newsletter, by clicking on the ‘Listen to this newsletter’ button. The newsletter will be sent out every weekday.
