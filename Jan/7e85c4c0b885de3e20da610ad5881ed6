PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The Western Australian Department of Mines, Industry Regulation and Safety has approved the mining proposal and closure plan of ASX-listed FYI Resource’s Cadoux kaolin project. FYI on Monday said that the approval paved the way for the company’s high purity alumina (HPA) project development. “With this important milestone now achieved and only minor regulatory approvals required prior to commencing development and mining activities, FYI will continue progressing its HPA strategy in anticipation of arranging full project funding and a formal decision to mine from the FYI board,” said MD Roland Hill. A 2018 prefeasibility study for the Cadoux project estimated that it could produce up to 8 000 t/y of HPA over a 25-year mine life, with capital costs estimated at $179-million. The HPA feedstock will be processed at a new battery metals center Kwinana, where kaolin will be directly refined into HPA.
