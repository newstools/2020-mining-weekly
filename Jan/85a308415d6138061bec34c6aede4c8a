PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Metals miner Independence Group on Wednesday reported that metal production in the first half of 2020 had beaten production expectations, with both the Nova and Tropicana mines delivering a strong December quarter. During the three months to December, the Nova mine, in Western Australia, produced 7 513 t of contained nickel, 3 289 t of contained copper and 279 t of contained cobalt, while Tropicana, also in Western Australia, produced 133 932 oz of gold, of which Independence’s share accounted for 38 612 oz. For the half-year ended December, the Nova mine delivered 15 236 t of contained nickel, 6 779 t of contained copper and 561 t of contained cobalt, which was higher than the expected 13 500 t to 15 000 t nickel, 5 500 t to 6 250 t copper and 425 t and 475 t cobalt targets previously set. The Tropicana gold mine also exceeded production expectations in the first half of 2020, delivering 257 252 oz, which was above the target of between 225 000 oz and 250 000 oz. “Production at Nova and Tropicana beat guidance in the December quarter and the first half of 2020, reflecting the quality of both operations and the dedication and focus of the Nova and Tropicana teams,” said Independence MD and CEO Peter Bradford. “Looking ahead to the second half of 2020, we are expecting Nova to maintain performance in line with guidance as we continue to focus on delivering cost improvements and continuous improvement of operational efficiencies. At Tropicana, we also expect to produce within guidance for the year, with lower gold production during the second half, in line with our mine plan.”
