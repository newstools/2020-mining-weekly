Aim-quoted Phoenix Copper has appointed COO Ryan McDermott its CEO with immediate effect, reflecting a change in operational emphasis as the company moves to expedite the timeframe to production from the Empire project, in Idaho, US. This year, the company will move from exploration and evaluation into project development, construction and production, which is anticipated in 2021. McDermott was already CEO of Phoenixâ€™s Idaho registered operating subsidiaries, which chairperson Marcus Edwards-Jones said on Thursday had proven his mine development and operating experience, as well as his excellent local contacts and knowledge. Dennis Thomas has stepped down from the role of CEO to serve as a nonexecutive director and VP of investor relations.
