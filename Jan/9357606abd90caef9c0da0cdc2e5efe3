ASX- and London-listed potash developer Danakali has made progress on Phase 1 of the Colluli project’s engineering, procurement and construction management contract. The company envisions that Phase 2 will start in mid-February, which will be followed by geotechnical investigation works that will start in March. Danakali had appointed consultancy DRA Global and multinational professional services company Turner and Townsend to review the Colluli front-end engineering design, which includes developing project systems, project controls and progress measurement monitoring. DRA had also started project management activities and mobilised its own engineering group for the process plant and associated infrastructure work. The consultancy had also undertaken a water intake area design for the Colluli project, which is based in Eritrea, East Africa. "I am very pleased with the progress achieved since commencement. We are near completion in formalising our partnership with DRA and are firmly moving into the development phase with some key works and activities in progress. “As part of the mobilisation phase, the project team has put in place a robust execution strategy as a basis of delivery throughout the life of the project,” said project director Tony Harrington.
