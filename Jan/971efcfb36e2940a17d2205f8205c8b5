De Beers Group’s diamond brand, Forevermark, unveiled the first boutique in its Next Generation Retail Concept, located within jewellery department store Caibai, in Beijing, China. The newly renovated 100 m2 boutique breaks away from the traditional across-the-counter service, inviting consumers to discover the world of Forevermark through an immersive, interactive and informative experience, the company explained in a statement on Friday. This is the first time Forevermark has offered this kind of consumer experience within one of its retail partners. The boutique includes several new innovations and digital experiences, including a discovery wall and two interactive discovery bars that sit at the heart of the boutique. Each bar provides a focal point for Forevermark ambassadors to offer inspiration, expertise and guidance. As a celebration of Forevermark’s pursuit of beauty, the discovery wall features stories on the origin of diamonds and the positive impact that Forevermark diamonds make to conserve, protect and restore the natural world. According to the statement, “it is a destination where consumers can explore and be directed through the journey of a Forevermark diamond”. Commenting on the unveiling, Forevermark CEO Nancy Liu said the Next Generation Retail Concept enables the company to offer customers “more than the traditional retail offering” through offering a place where “they can experience the world of Forevermark and discover the journey of their Forevermark diamond”. She added that the company focused on creating an environment that was open and welcoming. There is also a consultation lounge providing customers with a space to relax, browse iconic collections and receive services such as Forevermark jewellery cleaning and advice and expertise from Forevermark diamond experts.
