Canadian mining company Silvercorp, which produces silver, lead and zinc metals in concentrates from mines in China, is taking an extended holiday season, in line with the Chinese central government’s efforts to contain the spread of the coronavirus. Silvercorp’s production was suspended on January 17 for the Chinese New Year holiday, and was scheduled to restart on February 1. However, with the government extending the holiday by three days to February 3, Silvercorp will only restart production on February 10. The TSX-listed company expects to catch up the lost production time with shortened holidays in the future, it said in a statement on Wednesday. In the September quarter of 2019, Silvercorp produced 1.9-million ounces of silver, 1 100 oz of gold, 19.1-million pounds of lead and 6.7-million pounds of zinc. Its production figures for the December quarter will be announced on February 6.
