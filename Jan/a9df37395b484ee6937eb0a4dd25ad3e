PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Merger and acquisition (M&A) deal values in the mining and metals sector declined in 2019, compared with 2018, with the overall value falling by 39.14% from $101.6-billion to $61.8-billion, while deal volumes also decreased by 3.32%, from 1 385 transactions to 1 339 transactions, analytical firm GlobalData reported this week. Meanwhile, US multinational investment bank Citi came out on top of the list of the ten financial advisers for M&A activity in the mining sector in 2019. New data from GlobalData has shown that Citi was responsible for ten M&A transactions during 2019, with a combined value of $36.9-billion, followed by 12 deals undertaken by BMO Capital Markets, with a combined value of $36.8-billion.
