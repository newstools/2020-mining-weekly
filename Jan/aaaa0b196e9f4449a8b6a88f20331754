Vancouver-based SSR Mining has achieved record production again in 2019 on the back of solid operating performance at each of its three operations – Marigold, in the US, Seabee, in Canada and Puna, in Argentina. The company produced a record 421 906 gold-equivalent ounces (GEO) last year, including 106 208 GEO in the fourth quarter. Each operation exceeded the top end of SSR’s production guidance. Marigold produced 220 227 oz of gold – a record in its thirtieth year of continuous operation. Seabee produced 112 137 oz and Puna achieved 7.7-million ounces of silver. “We carry that momentum into 2020 where we anticipate another strong year of gold equivalent production,” said president and CEO Paul Benson. The company’s guidance for 2020 is to produce about 425 000 GEO at a cost of $740/oz, in 2020, with more records forecast at Marigold and Seabee. At Marigold, gold grades are anticipated to increase compared with 2019, resulting in higher production and robust margins. At Seabee, increased mill throughput and strong ore grades are anticipated to drive another record year of gold production. “Together with our exploration programs, we anticipate another successful year with our operating performance driving cash flow and generating value for our shareholders,” said Benson.
