Engineering company FLSmidth has appointed Mikko Keto as president of its mining unit within the company, effective July 2020. He will succeed Manfred Schaffer, who is retiring. Keto previously worked for Metso, where he served as mineral services and pumps president, as well as senior VP for various divisions. FLSmidth CEO Thomas Schulz says Keto will lead the FLSmidth mining unit in capturing profitable business opportunities. “He comes with extensive experience in service line management, spare parts and lifecycle offerings. He brings a strong commitment to customer partnerships and believes strongly in delivering significant enhancements in performance, sustainability and asset optimisation.” Schulz adds that Schaffer has helped to navigate an extended mining industry downturn and led the mining organisation through the transition to a new way of working.
