PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Agrimin has reported a 470% increase to the mineral resource at its Mackay potash project, in Western Australia. The project is estimated to host a drainable mineral resource of 123-million tonnes of sulphate of potash (SoP), with the in-situ mineral resource now exceeding one-billion tonnes of SoP, confirming the project as Australia’s largest SoP deposit. “We are delighted to announce a very significant upgrade to the mineral resource for the Mackay potash project. This is the culmination of several years of data collection and extensive hydrogeological modeling, which we believe to represent an industry leading level of rigour in de-risking the project,” said Agrimin CEO Mark Savich. “Importantly, the outcomes exceed the parameters used in the 2018 prefeasibility study,” Savich said. The study was based on the production of 426 000 t/y SoP over an initial mine life of 20 years, at an estimated capital cost of $409-million. A definitive feasibility study on the project is slated for completion over the coming months.
