Aim-listed Kodal Minerals has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with ASX-listed Mali Lithium, which is developing the Goulaminia project adjacent to Kodal’s Bougouni project, in Mali. The MoU encompasses general cooperation and the investigation of synergies in the development of the respective projects. The companies are looking to share certain infrastructure and operational support, including exploration and fieldwork facilities, workshop and storage facilities, supply chains for spares, reagents and fuel, transport and shipping, and community development projects. Additionally, the companies intend to negotiate an access agreement for the N’Kemene Ouest and Mafele Ouest concessions, which are owned by Kodal. “The two companies are operating in the same region of Mali and intend to develop similar lithium mining operations. It makes strong sense for the companies to work together, where possible, to improve the operations and financial return on the projects,” Kodal CEO Bernard Aylward said in a statement on Wednesday.
