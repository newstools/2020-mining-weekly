PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Diversified major Rio Tinto will commit up to A$5-million to develop a new state-of-the-art childcare centre in Tom Price, in Western Australia, in partnership with the Shire of Ashburton. The proposed facility will have capacity for 96 children and is projected to be open in 2021. It will provide both day care and after-school care facilities, a significant boost for local working families. The design phase of this project is proposed to begin shortly, with construction works forecast to commence in mid-2020. Rio and the Shire of Ashburton will now commence discussions on the terms of a binding funding agreement to support this commitment. This conditional funding commitment follows November’s approval of a $749-million investment in Rio’s greater Tom Price operations. The investment in the Western Turner Syncline Phase 2 mine will help sustain production capacity from greater Tom Price. Rio’s GM for the greater Tom Price operations, Jamie Robinson, said the company was proud to contribute towards the development of this new state-of-the-art facility. “Childcare is a critical service for the community here in Tom Price and the development of this new, modern center will enhance the town’s ability to attract and retain families, while also increasing local job opportunities. It will also provide a fantastic learning environment for children that attend. “Rio Tinto is listening to feedback from our monthly Local Voices surveys and will continue to invest in areas important to our community. We remain committed to improving the quality of the town’s assets, creating more regional jobs and maximising occupancy of company housing.”
