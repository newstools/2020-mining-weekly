BAMAKO â€“ Mali's industrial gold production rose 7% in 2019 to a record 65.1 t, mines ministry statistics showed on Wednesday. The increase was partly due to the launch of production at a mine owned by Australia's Resolute Mining, ministry official Mamadou Sidibe said. The West African country's total gold output last year was probably around 71.1 t due to the additional 6 t of gold that artisanal miners are estimated to produce each year, Sidibe said. Industrial production is expected to increase further in 2020, he said, without giving further details.
