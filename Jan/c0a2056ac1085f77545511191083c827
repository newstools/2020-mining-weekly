PERTH (miningweekly.com) â€“ Operations at the Curragh coal mine, in Queensland, are expected to resume from Friday, ASX-listed Coronado Global Resources said on Thursday. The company earlier this week suspended operations at Curragh after a contractor employee was fatally injured during a tyre change activity at the main workshop. The Queensland Mines Inspectorate has issued a directive that all relevant tyre and wheel rim fitting activities would be suspended until it was satisfied that the activities could restart safely, with Coronado not being permitted these activities on site until both the company and the Inspectorate were satisfied with the safety of these activities. CEO Gerry Spindler said that the company was conducting a full investigation to understand the cause of the incident, and was continuing its support of third party reviews currently under way.
