PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Gold developer Theta Gold Mines on Tuesday told shareholders that a plant optimisation study at its namesake project, in South Africa, has found that the throughput capacity at the plant could increase from the originally anticipated 500 000 t/y to 600 000 t/y at minimal costs. Theta noted that the 20% increase in the new plant design would be achieved with less than a 1% change to the processing plant capital of $24.85-million, estimated in the feasibility study. The increased design parameters incorporated the newly purchased 2.5 MW ball mill, the ASX-listed company said. “The optimisation plant design study completed for the Theta project is further demonstration of the robust nature of the project. The inclusion of the 2.5 MW mill and new design work means the plant can be readily expanded in future,” said chairperson Bill Guy. “The company has not lost sight of its medium-term production target of 100 000 oz/y,” Guy added.
