TSX-V-listed M3 Metals is looking for a partner to take its Block 103 iron-ore project, in Newfoundland and Labrador, to feasibility study and production, after a rescaling of the project significantly reduced the capital expenditure. A rescoping study, completed by Hatch, slashed the projected capital costs on the project from about C$6-billion in the 2013 preliminary economic assessment (PEA) to C$840-million, by implementing a phased approach. The project will now start with a base case of four-million tonnes a year of high-grade iron-ore fines concentrate (67.6% iron), from the previously proposed 16-million tonnes a year. The rescoping study also modifies processing methods and introduces new efficiencies. The study presents a projected operating cost per tonne for the base case at C$51/t freight on board cost, excluding shipping costs. Previously, the company has spent more than $38-million advancing the project to the PEA stage. As a result, the company defined a total of 7.2-billion tonnes at 29.2% total iron with metallurgical test results showing a projected 69.5% iron concentrate, and low 0.4:1 strip ratio. The new rescoping study was mandated to consider alternative rescaled schemes that could make the Block 103 project economically viable and more attractive for potential investment. “When you consider the current and growing demand for the premium iron-ore product that could be produced from our project, adjust based on currency and the premium value gained for the high-grade material, the economics look very promising,” commented M3 Metals president Adrian Smith.
