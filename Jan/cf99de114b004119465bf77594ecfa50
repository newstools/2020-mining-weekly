Dual-listed miner Sibanye-Stillwater’s South African gold operations achieved ten-million fatality-free shifts on Sunday. In a statement on Monday, the company indicated that this was a significant milestone, having never been achieved in the history of these gold operations, or in the history of the country's deep-level gold mining industry. “The South Africa gold operations are among the deepest in the world, extending to more than 3 km below surface, which makes it a truly worthy achievement considering that it was accomplished by 30 000 employees and contractors working safely for eight-and-a-half hours a day over a 519-day period since August 25, 2018,” the company said. “Milestones like these illustrate what can be achieved when all stakeholders contribute constructively and work together. “Special appreciation goes to our workforce for working safely and living our CARES (commitment, accountability, respect, enabling, safety) values. Our intense focus on safe production across the group continues, with the implementation of longer-term safety and cultural interventions a strategic priority,” commented Sibanye CEO Neal Froneman. Sibanye’s announcement follows days after South Africa’s Department of Mineral Resources and Energy announced 2019 as the year in which the country achieved the lowest ever number - 51 - of mining fatalities.
