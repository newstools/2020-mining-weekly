PERTH (miningweekly.com) – An estimated 21 000 new workers will be required in the resources sector by 2024, new data from The Australian Resources and Energy Group (AMMA) has suggested. Mining plant operators, engineers and geologists and electrical and mechanical tradesman have been listed as the top positions on the ‘most wanted’ list, data analyst GlobalData said this week. “The AMMA predicts that of the 20 767 employees needed in Australia’s mining sector by 2024, mining plant operators will see the most demand, with a total of 8 660 operators required across the country’s 57 total projects,” said GlobalData’s mining technology writer Umar Ali. Western Australia accounts for more than 50% of this demand, with AMMA expecting that 4 464 mining plant operators will be needed in the region. “Engineers, technicians, geologists and related roles are the second-largest group of jobs in AMMA’s report, with a total of 4 180 across Australia. Of the ‘white collar’ jobs in AMMA’s report, engineers, technicians and geologists will require the most growth across Australia, with Western Australia once again leading in demand with 2 138 required jobs,” Ali said. He noted that supervisors, management, administration and other white collar roles would account for 4 110 of Australia’s 20 767 required mining jobs, with these management roles expected to play an important part in maintaining Australia’s growing mining sector, with significant management structures needed to accommodate the growth predicted by AMMA. “Trades such as electrical, mechanical and maintenance roles account for 970 of the 20 767 jobs AMMA predicts Australia’s mining sector will need for 2024, the smallest demographic represented in the report. “While these roles require the smallest amount of new jobs according to AMMA’s report, electrical and mechanical roles will still be an essential part of Australia’s mining sector, particularly in conjunction with global efforts to reduce emissions,” Ali added.
