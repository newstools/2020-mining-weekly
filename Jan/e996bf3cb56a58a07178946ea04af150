PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The Tasmanian rescue crews at the Henty gold mine have given up hope of finding the missing miner alive. The miner, employed by services provider PYBAR, has been missing since 4am on Thursday following an earth collapse at the gold mine. “Police and the mine’s Emergency Response Team used drones with 3D and thermal imaging technology to access the area and have been unable to establish signs of life. Using the imagery and technical information to assess the site it can only be concluded that he died in the incident,” the Tasmanian police said on Friday. Rescue crews will continue to work with the mine on recovery efforts. “We are devastated and saddened by these recent developments and our thoughts and prayers are with our missing colleague’s family, friends and workmates. We have been in constant contact with family members and continue to provide as much support as we can,” PYBAR CEO Brendan Rouse said. “We are also working to address the impact of this incident on management, staff and emergency personnel through the provision of on-site support and counselling services.”
