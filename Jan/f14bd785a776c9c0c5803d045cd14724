The Competition Commission has approved the proposed merger whereby Brother Industrial South Africa (Brothers SA) wants to acquire Lanxess CISA and the chrome chemicals business of Lanxess SA. Brothers SA was established by the Brother Group to effect the transaction. The group is involved in the research, development and manufacturing of new fine chemical products, including vitamins and leather chemicals, which are distributed in China. Lanxess CISA manufactures chrome chemicals from production plants in Newcastle and Merebank, in KwaZulu-Natal. The chrome chemicals business unit of Lanxess SA produces chrome tanning salts (CTS). The CTS business sources sodium dichromate from Lanxess CISA and converts it to CTS.
