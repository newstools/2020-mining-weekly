Independent proxy advisers Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis & Co. (Glass Lewis) have recommended that shareholders vote for the merger between Canadian miners Equinox Gold and Leagold Mining. Shareholders of both companies will meet separately on January 28 to consider the merger, which was announced last month. The transaction is expected to close in late February, subject to all necessary securityholder and regulatory approvals. In December, the TSX-listed companies entered into a definitive agreement to combine in an at-market merger. The combined entity will continue as Equinox Gold and be headquartered in Vancouver. The new Equinox will produce 700 000 oz in 2020, increasing to one-million ounces a year in 2021 and beyond, from six operating mines in the US, Mexico and Brazil.
