Precious metals miner Sibanye-Stillwater on Monday revealed that it was the only company from South Africa to have achieved an 'A' rating for its climate change disclosure by nonprofit global environmental disclosure platform CDP. "CDP’s annual environmental disclosure and scoring process is widely recognised as the gold standard of corporate environmental transparency, supported by substantial investors globally who requested companies to disclose data on environmental impacts, risks and opportunities through CDP’s platform. Over 8 400 companies participated during the most recent CDP process," the miner pointed out. It added that it was one of only 179 companies globally to receive an 'A' rating and that it would also be included in the STOXX Global Climate Change Leaders Index, which is based on the CDP A List. “We are pleased to be recognised for our commitment to, and disclosure on, climate change. The recognition from CDP comes at a crucial time where the impacts of environmental, social and governance (ESG) are becoming more pronounced. As the largest primary producer of platinum group metals (PGMs), the metals of which are used in the production of catalytic converters in automobiles to remove noxious gasses from exhaust fumes, Sibanye-Stillwater is committed to expanding its role in providing a cleaner and sustainable environment and improving lives. "Consistent with our renewed strategic focus on ESG, we continue to look at how we can improve our performance, not only on the environmental front, but across various ESG disciplines,” commented Sibanye CEO Neal Froneman. In addition to its PGMs operations in South Africa, JSE- and NYSE-listed Sibanye also operates a platinum and palladium mine in the US and gold mines in South Africa.
