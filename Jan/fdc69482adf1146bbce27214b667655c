Vancouver-based Eldorado Gold has appointed Goldcorp’s former Latin America senior VP, Joe Dick, as its new executive VP and COO, succeeding Paul Skayman, who is retiring after almost 15 years with the company. Dick, joined the company at the end of last year, has more than 30 years of operational and leadership experience in companies such as Rio Tinto, Barrick Gold and Goldcorp, Eldorado pointed out in a statement on Tuesday. Meanwhile, the mid-tier miner also announced that its production of 395 331 oz of gold in 2019 was in line with its guidance of 390 000 oz to 420 000 oz, despite its largest mine’s output falling short of its target for the year. The Kisladag mine, in Turkey, produced 140 214 oz, compared with 172 009 oz in 2018. Eldorado explained that while gold recovery at Kisladag met expectations, production was slightly less than its guidance, owing to a slower ramp up of crushing and stacking and longer-than-expected solution flows through the leach pad. The miner announced in April last year that it would resumed heap leaching at Kisladag. The Kisladag technical report would be updated during the current quarter to reflect heap leaching with a longer leach cycle, as supported by 2019 metallurgical test work, Eldorado stated. Its Efemcukuru mine, also in Turkey, improved its yearly production from 95 038 oz in 2018 to 103 767 oz, while the new Lamaque mine, in Canada, produced 133 940 oz. Olympias, in Greece, reported lower production of 37 410 oz, compared with 46 750 oz in 2018. The miner’s year-end results would be published on February 20.
