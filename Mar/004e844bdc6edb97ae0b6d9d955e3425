Gold mining company AngloGold Ashanti, which is in the process of exiting its last remaining South African operations, on Friday confirmed that the dead bodies of three employees had been found at the Mponeng mine, which is being disposed of to Harmony Gold. A magnitude two seismic event at Mponeng – the world’s deepest mine – on Thursday afternoon resulted in a fall of ground in a work area 3.5 km below surface. Four workers rescued from the affected area were receiving medical care, AngloGold’s Stewart Bailey confirmed by phone earlier on Friday. JSE-listed Harmony Gold was recently announced as the most suitable party to acquire Mponeng and Mine Waste Solutions for an expected $300-million, subject to post-sale performance. AngloGold – headed by CEO Kelvin Dushnisky, who has just been announced as the new chairperson of the World Gold Council – last year undertook a process of disposal of its remaining South African assets. It states on its website that it will be retaining its interest in the Rand Refinery, Africa’s biggest gold refinery in Germiston, as well as honouring its post-retirement medical cost obligations applicable to retired and remaining employees, as well as obligations under the silicosis class action settlement agreement. The JSE- and New York-listed company has 14 gold operations in nine countries.
