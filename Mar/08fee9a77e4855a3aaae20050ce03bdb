Spain has implemented enhanced measures to protect its people from the fast-spreading coronavirus with a new royal decree on Sunday stipulating that only employees from essential industries are allowed to work for the next week-and-a-half. The list of essential industries excludes mining and consequently, Aim- and TSX-listed Atalaya Mining on Monday announced that its Proyecto Riotinto copper mine would cease operations until April 10. The company said in a statement that it would maintain a minimum workforce for care-and-maintenance work during the stoppage. Spain has been in lockdown for two weeks under a national state of emergency and on Sunday tightened controls, as the number of infections and deaths from Covid-19 continues to increase. At the time of writing, the country had 85 195 coronavirus cases, of which 4 165 are considered in serious or critical condition. The country has already reported 7 340 deaths from the virus.
