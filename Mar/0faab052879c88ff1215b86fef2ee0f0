PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Graphite junior Bass Metals has announced plans to place its Graphmada mine, in Madagascar, on care and maintenance. Mining at Graphmada was paused earlier in the year with the onset of the monsoon season, and operations were initially slated to restart in April. However, the company on Wednesday said that given the current uncertainty brought on by Covid-19, the company had taken the decision to suspend mining and processing, and to place the project on care and maintenance until "some clarity in the current situation emerges". Bass told shareholders that it would continue with its current exploration programme at Graphmada as well as continue to progress its feasibility studies for the next stage of operations.
