ASX-listed Lucapa Diamonds has recovered a top-quality 64 ct D-colour Type Ila diamond at the Mothae project, in Lesotho. The 64 ct diamond is the twelfth diamond larger than 50 ct recovered at the mine since commercial production started in January 2019. This recovery “underlines Mothae’s status as a source of large and premium-value diamonds,” Lucapa said in a release on Wednesday.
