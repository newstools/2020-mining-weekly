Dual-listed Botswana Diamonds has started a bulk sampling campaign at its Marsfontein project, in South Africa, where kimberlite was previously identified as being of “high interest”. Treatment will be undertaken at a nearby diamond processing facility using two-stage crushing, screening, pans, X-ray and grease recovery processes. The recently declared National State of Disaster in South Africa, owing to the coronavirus, would, however, impact on the scheduling of the project in the coming weeks, the diamond explorer said in a statement on Wednesday.
