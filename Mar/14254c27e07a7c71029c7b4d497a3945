Diversified gold and silver producer McEwen Mining will scale down both the Black Fox mine in Canada, and the Gold Bar mine, in the US, from March 26 for a period of 14 days to try to prevent the spread of Covid-19. Certain production and exploration activities will continue at Gold Bar in areas where social distancing can be observed, including ore crushing, irrigation of the heap leach pad and operation of the process plant. At Black Fox, the company expects to continue development activities related to the Froome access ramp. Both sites will continue to be minimally staffed to ensure safety, security and environmental compliance. McEwenâ€™s projects in Mexico are continuing to operate normally.
