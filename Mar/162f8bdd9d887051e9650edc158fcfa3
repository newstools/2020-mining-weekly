PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Diversified major BHP has confirmed the contractors appointed for the pre-front-end engineering design, or FEED, design competition for the Trion floating production unit. The miner has confirmed that SBM Offshore USA, Technip USA, Genesis North America and McDermott have been selected to deliver an early engineering study for a semisubmersible floating production unit (FPU) for the Trion field in the deep-water Gulf of Mexico. The design contracts have been awarded following a competitive tender process, and the work is anticipated to be completed within six months. BHP president operations petroleum, Geraldine Slattery, said on Monday that this was another step forward for the Trion project, which allowed for early engagement with the chosen contractors to optimise the design together with the contracting and execution strategy options for the FPU delivery. “We look forward to working with the selected contractors through this study phase.” BHP holds a 60% interest in Trion, while Mexico’s PEMEX holds a 40% interest. BHP in 2016 won the right to acquire a 60% participating interest in the oil field, which is expected to host a gross recoverable resource of 485-million barrels of oil equivalent. BHP’s bid for Trion included an up-front cash payment of $62.4-million and a minimum $320-million work programme commitment.
