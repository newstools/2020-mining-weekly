PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Graphite miner Syrah Resources has suspended production at the Balama project, in Mozambique, as local restrictions to halt the spread of Covid-19, take a toll. Syrah said on Friday that the government of Mozambique had enacted additional measures including the suspension of all in-bound travel visa operations and mandating a 14-day self-quarantine for all international arrivals. In addition, restrictions and mandatory quarantine measures for domestic travel were also being implemented. Syrah told shareholders that the combination of these restrictions on international and domestic travel limited the mobility of a significant portion of the Balama workforce, prompting a decision to suspend production at Balama from March 28. Sales orders from existing finished product inventory will continue to be dispatched, the ASX-listed company said, with finished product from Balama to be dispatched through the Port of Nacala, although this could change. Syrah earlier this month temporarily suspended its battery anode material project, in Louisiana, delaying the distribution of purified natural graphite samples for qualification with potential customers. The Governor of Louisiana earlier this month issued a “stay at home” order to fight the spread of Covid-19, with the order to last until April 13.
