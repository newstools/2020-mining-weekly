PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Rare earths producer Northern Minerals has temporarily suspended operations at the Browns Range project, in Western Australia, owing to the Covid-19 pandemic. The ASX-listed company told shareholders that given the extreme remoteness of the site, operations have been moved to care and maintenance immediately, as the company moved to comply with travel restrictions within regional Western Australia. “We understand this decision will have a significant impact on all our employees. These are difficult, uncertain and unprecedented times. These decisions are not made lightly and are taken to ensure the health and safety of our employees and the community within which we operate,” said Northern Minerals MD and CEO George Bauk. “While this decision will obviously have a significant impact in the near term, we are hopeful that our resilience and adaptability will ensure our longevity and that Northern Minerals will be ready to rebound when the global situation improves.” A small care-and-maintenance team will remain on site and will alternate on a four-weekly roster.
