PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Gold miner Blackham Resources has warned shareholders that gold production for the full year would likely be at the lower end of the guidance of between 70 000 oz and 80 000 oz. Blackham noted that third-quarter production had been impacted by non-recurrent seasonal weather and operational issues during the first two months of the quarter, with production returning to normalized levels during March. “Within the current quarter of dramatic global change due to Covid-19, Blackham has been relentless in advancing our stated two-year transformation plan; we have added clout and expertise to our leadership team, refinanced the company and achieve fantastic initial underground exploration results, while significantly upgrading the processing capacity and development of our Wiluna gold mine,” said Blackham executive chairperson Milan Jerkovic. “Looking ahead at the fourth quarter, we reaffirm our commitment to shareholders to deliver on our five-point strategy of transitioning to gold concentrate production, increasing operational cashflows, repairing the balance sheet, expanding gold production and advancing under the headframe exploration to underpin a future 250 000 oz/y long-life gold operation.”
