Phosphates and phosphoric acid producer Foskor has advised that it will not be operating during South Africa’s national lockdown period – March 26 to April 16 – although the company qualifies as an essential service provider. Foskor in a statement on March 25 explained that the continuation of its operations required the assistance of service providers and suppliers over which the company did not have any control during this time. Owing to these circumstances, Foskor has had to declare a force majeure, rendering it unable to take delivery of the relevant product. The company further said that it was too early to determine the exact impact of the lockdown on Foskor’s operations and ability to accept deliveries.
