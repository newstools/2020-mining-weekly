Aim-listed emerging phosphate producer Kropz on Monday announced that its appeal hearing before the Water Tribunal, regarding the Elandsfontein project’s integrated water-use licence, had been postponed. The appeal hearing was supposed to convene on Monday, but has been postponed owing to certain parties undergoing self-quarantine. These people recently arrived back in South Africa from Covid-19-affected regions and were now following government’s guidelines that had been imposed effective immediately. After many delays to its project starting up, Kropz planned to start commercial production from Elandsfontein in the last quarter of 2021. The project had raised environmental concerns from its inception, owing to it being situated on top of an aquifer.
