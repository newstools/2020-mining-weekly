PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Ore haulage from the Marda gold mine, in Western Australia, to the Edna May processing facility has officially started, gold miner Ramelius Resources said on Tuesday. Mining operations at Marda began in November of last year, with Ramelius trucking the Marda ore some 170 km to its Edna May mill, where it will be blended with ore from openpit and underground deposits, including the Greenfinch openpit operation, adjacent to Edna May, where mining operations have started earlier than expected. It is estimated that some 75 000 t of ore is currently stockpiled at Marda, with the project expected to contribute some 10 000 oz to group production in the June quarter of this year. The Marda project is expected to generate exceptional cashflows, improve the efficiency at Edna May, and be a key contributor to Ramelius’ mine plan through to at least 2024, the miner told shareholders. “The successful commencement of mining and haulage at the Marda gold mine is an exciting milestone for Ramelius, proving we can replicate the integration of satellite deposits with our suite of existing operations,” said MD Mark Zeptner. “The Marda deposit will enhance the ore feed at the Edna May production center and contribute to our production for years to come.” Zeptner noted that Greenfinch is also expected to contribute strongly to the Edna May operation over the next two years.
