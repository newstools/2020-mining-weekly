Recently completed drilling at the Las Chispas project, in Sonara, Mexico, has doubled the size of the Babi Vista vein, Vancouver-headquartered SilverCrest Metals announced on Monday. The in-fill and expansion drill results for Babi Vista show higher-grade vein mineralisation to depth, including hole UBV19-30 with 2.1 m grading 12 740 g/t silver equivalent The company on Monday announced the results of 22 drill holes, which follows 14 drill hole results announced previously. Based on the 36 drill holes, the updated high-grade footprint is about 400 m along vein strike by 150 m in height, and open along strike, towards surface and at depth. Within this footprint, the estimated average true width and grade of the vein is 1.2 m grading 16.18 g/t gold and 1 272.9 g/t silver, or 2 486 g/t silver-equivalent. This average grade of silver-equivalent is 230% higher than the previous estimate of 753 g/t (at 2.2 m grading 4.70 g/t gold and 401.1 g/t silver, with a reduction in estimated average vein width of 45%. “In the last six months of drilling, the Babicanora vein, including Area 51 zone has gone from being the vein with the highest-grade of silver-equivalent on the project to fourth on the list, now superseded by the Area 200 zone, Area 118 zone and now Babi Vista. “Babi Vista mineralisation starts about 50 m below the surface and is open in all directions. The vein is approximately 230 m north of the Babicanora Vein and was discovered while driving the Santa Rosa Decline to the Area 51 zone,” said CEO Eric Fier. With the infill drilling programme complete, SilverCrest is now operating 12 drill rigs, which are focusing on the extensions of high-grade veins including several new blind veins that are being intercepted as drilling continues along the strike of the Babicanora veins.
