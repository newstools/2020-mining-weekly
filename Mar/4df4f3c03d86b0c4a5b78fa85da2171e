PERTH (miningweekly.com) â€“ Gold miner Silver Lake Resources has reported a maiden mineral resource estimate of 634 000 t for the Deflector South West deposit, increasing the mineral resource estimate for the entire Deflector project, in Western Australia. Grading 14.9% gold and 0.6% copper, the Deflector South West deposit is estimated to host some 304 000 oz of gold and 3 600 t of copper. The Deflector South West deposit is located adjacent to the Deflector mine, which at the end of June last year had a mineral resource estimate of some 828 000 oz of gold and 14 100 t of copper. Silver Lake told shareholders on Tuesday that since its acquisition of the Deflector project in April of last year, the operation has grown in quality, scale and has significantly increased life-of-mine visibility through a combination of exploration and merger and acquisition success. The company noted that it would continue to invest in exploration to complement its strategy of targeting proven mineralised corridors and leveraging infrastructure to deliver growth. The growth in the mineral resource at Deflector is expected to enhance the returns derived from the proposed upgrade of the processing facility to include a carbon-in-pulp circuit to complement the existing gravity and flotation circuits.
