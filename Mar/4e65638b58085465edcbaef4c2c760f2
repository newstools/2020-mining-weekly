PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The majority of resources companies in Queensland will either maintain or increase their workforce during Covid-19, a new survey by the Queensland Resources Council (QRC) has found. QRC CEO Ian Macfarlane said during these turbulent times the resources sector was considered an essential service by both the federal and state governments to fast-track the economy to recovery mode. “The survey found that 58% of companies were maintaining or planning to grow current workforce numbers over the next three months and only 21%, or one in five, expected a decrease,” Macfarlane said. “The results show Covid-19 has not significantly impacted jobs in our sector in Queensland at this stage with a similar survey taken in the December quarter reporting that 15% of companies were expecting to decrease their workforce, a difference of 6% from this survey. “Every company is working hard to make working arrangements more flexible with 95% of companies offering either additional sick leave or access to future balances to support their workers through Covid-19.” Macfarlane noted that payroll tax relief announced by the state government was well received by companies, with over a quarter reporting it had helped to maintain jobs. “The QRC and its members have outlined that the state government could provide help through measures which ‘suspend and extend’ tenure requirements. This would include the suspension of required compliance with work programs and an extension of upcoming relinquishment requirements. These measures would allow companies to focus on staff retention over the coming months,” he said.
