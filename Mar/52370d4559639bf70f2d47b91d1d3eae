The illegal blockade of roads in the San José del Progreso municipality, which prevented access to NYSE- and TSX-listed Fortuna Silver Mines’ San José mine, in Mexico, has been lifted. Operations resumed on March 25 and started with the night shift. Fortuna is a precious metals producer focused on mining opportunities in Latin America, and its primary assets are the Caylloma silver mine in southern Peru, the San Jose silver/gold mine in Mexico and the Lindero gold project that is under construction in Argentina.
