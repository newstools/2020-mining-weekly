TSX-listed Calibre Mining has started the legal process with the Nicaraguan Ministry of Labour to obtain authorisation for the temporary suspension of its El Limon and La Libertad mines. According to CEO Russell Ball, the company has implemented several mitigation measures across the business and has, to date, no confirmed cases of Covid-19 at any of its locations. However, owing to the rapidly deteriorating global environment and the increasing logistical challenges sourcing consumables, reagents and other supplies, Calibre has taken “the proactive step of temporarily suspending operations.” The company will maintain personnel at each site as required to ensure environmental compliance, progress ongoing permitting and technical studies, and maintain operational readiness. However, Calibre says it cannot estimate the duration nor the impact of the suspension and is accordingly withdrawing its 2020 guidance.
