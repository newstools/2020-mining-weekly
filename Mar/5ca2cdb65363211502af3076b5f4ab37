PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Lithium developer Lake Resources has delivered 20 000 l of brine samples from its Kachi lithium brine project, in Argentina, to its technology partner Lilac Solutions’ direct extraction ion exchange pilot plant in California. Lilac will process the brine to produce high purity lithium chloride for conversion to battery-grade lithium carbonate. “Our key focus at this time is to prove conclusively that the Lilac Solutions pilot-scale ion exchange module can consistently process the Kachi brines into high purity, battery grade lithium carbonate at volume, as sought by potential buyers,” said Lake MD Steve Promnitz. He noted that with the support from its investors and from Lilac, Lake was now well positioned to advance its flagship Kachi project and to ensure the delivery of a sustainable and scalable solution fit for market. Lilac is expected to produce the battery-grade lithium carbonate in April.
