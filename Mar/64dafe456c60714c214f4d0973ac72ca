JSE-listed Wescoal has implemented measures to minimise the spread of Covid-19, as well as business continuity plans for the 21-day lockdown in South Africa. Coal producers and power stations are classified as essential service in South Africa and are to remain operational. Additionally, Wescoal supplies coal to other essential services like hospitals through its trading business. By virtue of this, Wescoal is an essential service provider in the electricity and energy space. While core, essential functions in the organisation will be required to continue working throughout the lockdown, Wescoal says it has undertaken to act responsibly and to do its part in preventing further spread of the coronavirus, by implementing business continuity measures together with its mining contractors across the breadth of its operations. These include controls and protocols to ensure the health and safety of all staff on its sites, without any business interruptions using technologies to facilitate operational and head office meetings and to work remotely as appropriate. This includes measures such as support functions being required to work remotely, as well as alternate shifts as required; inter-provincial travellers being required to work remotely from home; and critical meetings taking place online. Moreover, the company noted that it is keeping in frequent and close contact with State-owned power utility Eskom, which buys the majority of its production. Eskom has confirmed the status of Wescoal as an essential services provider in the electricity generation value chain, and specifically requested the continuity and uninterrupted supply of Wescoalâ€™s contracted coal to its power stations during the national lockdown period.
