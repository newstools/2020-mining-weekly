PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The Queensland government has granted two junior explorers the right to explore and develop gas on 164 km2 of highly prospective land in south-west Queensland. Mines Minister Dr Anthony Lynham said the blocks were close to existing gas infrastructure and near Australia’s gas hub in Wallumbilla in Queensland’s world-class Surat basin. “These latest approvals for Pure Energy/Strata X and Santos will help unlock more gas supply. More potential gas in the pipeline will provide further security for users and the jobs that flow from it. “The government is doing all we can to get more gas into the market, because industry here and around the world need our mineral and energy resources. Our resources will support business and industry in continuing to operate through this coronavirus pandemic, and, most importantly, keep people in jobs,” the Minister said. This year alone, the state government has released 7 000 km2 of land for resources exploration to identify the next generation of projects and the jobs that will flow from them. Pure Energy/Strata X’s Venus project would explore a 153 km2 block west of Miles and Santos will explore two blocks totalling 101 km2 near Wallumbilla.
