Gold miner Agnico Eagle Mines has sent home its Nunavut-based work force (Nunavummiut) from the Meliadine and Meadowbank operations, as well as the exploration projects, for four weeks to protect the communities from the coronavirus. Agnico Eagle will also be meeting with its Nunavut contractors to discuss similar measures involving their Nunavummiut workers. “We value our relationship with the people of Nunavut and are committed to do what is best for the health, safety and wellbeing of all our employees and the communities,” said Agnico CEO Sean Boyd. "This precautionary measure is being implemented in order to eliminate the potential risk of transmission of Covid-19 from a southern worker to a Nunavut worker, with the risk of it moving into the communities." Agnico Eagle plans to continue operations at Meliadine and Meadowbank with the remaining workforce.
