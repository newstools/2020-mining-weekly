Diversified major Anglo American has withdrawn the majority of employees and contractors from its $5.3-billion Quellaveco copper project, in Peru, to comply with a 15-day national quarantine announced to curb the spread of the pandemic. The 10 000-strong construction workforce is being demobilised and work on the project will be slowed, with only critical areas of the project continuing until workers can safely return. “The health and safely of everyone must come first, ever more so at times such as these,” said CEO Mark Cutifani. He noted that the development of the project had progressed ahead of schedule and within its budget and that it would be able to accommodate the slowdown within its market guidance. The Quellaveco copper project is expected to begin production in 2022, with an expected capital cost of $5-billion to $5.3-billion. During the first ten years of full production, Quellaveco is expected to produce approximately 300 000 t/y at a cash cost of $1.05/lb.
