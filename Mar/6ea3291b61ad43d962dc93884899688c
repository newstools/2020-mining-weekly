PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Syrah Resources will temporarily suspend its battery anode material project, in Louisiana, delaying the distribution of purified natural graphite samples for qualification with potential customers. The Governor of Louisiana earlier this month issued a “stay at home” order to fight the spread of COVID-19, with the order to last until April 13. Syrah told shareholders that its team in the US would continue to progress the feasibility study for the scale up of the Vidalia facility, post production qualifications. Meanwhile, the Balama graphite operation, in Mozambique, remains operational, with Syrah saying that it would continue to monitor and assess the international mobility of personnel, the free movement of goods through supply chains, and the broader market conditions.
