Diversified miner Sumitomo Corporation has temporarily suspended operations at its Minera San Cristobal silver/zinc/lead mining project, in Bolivia, as well as the Ambatovy nickel project, in Madagascar, to prevent the spread of Covid-19. In Bolivia and Madagascar, all-day or night curfews have been imposed and public transportation has been suspended. Considering the impact of these measures, including difficulties of securing access to the operations for employees and the effects of logistic stagnation, Sumitomo has decided to suspend operations temporarily to ensure the safety of employees and their families. This suspension excludes any facilities that require continuous operation, such as power plants. A comprehensive assessment of the impact of this situation to the companyâ€™s financial result on 2019 and 2020 is ongoing.
