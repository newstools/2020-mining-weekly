The Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU) reported on Friday afternoon that it had learnt of fatalities at AngloGold Ashanti’s Mponeng mine, in Gauteng, and Sibanye-Stillwater’s Thembelani shaft, in the North West. The union said in a statement that the AngloGold incident happened on March 16 when a locomotive operator was fatally injured as he was caught between a material car and a loader. AMCU further explained that the incident at Sibanye involved a fall-of-ground on March 20, which fatally injured a rock drill operator. The union reiterated its clarion call for mining bosses to invest more of their profits in safety systems and infrastructure, while AMCU also called on the Department of Mineral Resources to implement stronger regulation and enforcement around safety.
