Natural resources company Jangada Mines has adapted its diamond drilling programme at the Pitombeiras Vanadium project, in Brazil, a measure taken to address the impact of Covid-19 on its activities. Given the prevailing environment, the company has decided to reduce the programme from 2 500 m to a total of about 1 350 m. To date, 908 m of drilling has been completed in 2020 for a total of eight holes, of which assay results have been received for three, including newly received hole DD20PI13, which intersected 31.57 m at 0.448% vanadium pentoxide, 8.66% titanium and 44.88% iron oxide. Jangada will conclude its programme with an additional seven diamond drilling holes, or 420 m, by April. The reduction of metres is substantially as a result of drilling the holes to a shallower depth. Jangada said that the scale back would not have a material impact on the company’s immediate plans as it would still have sufficient data to continue with a preliminary economic assessment and Joint Ore Reserve Committee-compliant resource estimate. The reduction in the drilling programme would also result in a cost saving, which the company noted as prudent in the current environment. Thirteen drill holes have now been completed to date including 2019 and 2020 diamond drilling programme for a total of 1 235.65 m.
