Aim-listed Kropz has advised that all its employees based in South Africa will be working from home during the national lockdown declared from March 26 midnight to April 16. Kropz does not anticipate its Elandsfontein phosphate mine, in the Western Cape, being adversely impacted on by the lockdown, as the company was still waiting for the Water Tribunal to reschedule a hearing into the water-use licence for the mine. The hearing is likely to only be scheduled after the lockdown period. The company will therefore continue to perform care-and-maintenance activities on site. Kropz is also monitoring the situation in Congo-Brazzaville, where its 100%-owned Hinda project is based. So far, that country has only closed its air, land and maritime borders, effective March 21, but has not implemented a nationwide lockdown.
