Mali-focused explorer Compass Gold on Monday announced the appointment of Joe Conway as chairperson of its board. Conway has 30 years of mining and financial industry experience, including his tenure as president and CEO of Canadian miner Iamgold from 2003 to 2010. The appointment follows the resignation from the chairperson’s position of James Henderson, who will remain on the board as a nonexecutive director. “In view of increasing executive responsibilities in Australia with the Transocean Group, I am delighted to be able to pass the baton of chair of the Compass Board to such an outstanding gold industry figure as Joe Conway. His network amongst North American investors will complement the increasing influence of North American shareholders in Compass Gold. I look forward to continuing as a non-executive director on the board and as a significant shareholder of Compass for the next phase of an exciting future,” commented Henderson in a statement. Henderson is the founder and executive chairperson of Transocean Securities, which was established in 1987. Conway has served as a non-executive director with Compass since the company’s acquisition of Mali Gold Exploration in November 2017. Compass’ exploration permits comprise the Sikasso property.  The exploration permits are located in three sites in southern Mali with a combined land holding of 867 km2. The Sikasso Property is located in the same region as several multimillion-ounce gold projects, including Morila, Syama, Kalana and Kodiéran.
