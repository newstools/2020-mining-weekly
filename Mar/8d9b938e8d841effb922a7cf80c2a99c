Following the South African National Coronavirus Command Council’s decision to effect a nationwide lockdown for 21 days from midnight on March 26 to April 16 to combat the Covid-19 epidemic, Aim-listed Afarak Group is developing a plan to cope with the “extraordinary measures” and preserve the health and safety of the workers and the population. Among many other measures, all the companies whose operations require continuous processes such as furnaces and underground mine operations will be required to make arrangements for care and maintenance to avoid damage to their continuous operations. Afarak’s Ferroalloys business is located in Southern Africa and consists of the Stellite chrome mine, the Mecklenburg mine, the Mogale Alloys processing plant and the Vlakpoort mine in South Africa.
