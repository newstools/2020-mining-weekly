The Santander zinc/lead mine is continuing to operate during Peru’s national emergency, but TSX-listed Trevali Mining reported on Friday that the country’s extension of the emergency would impact on processing at the 2 000 t/d operation. The Vanouver-based miner said that it would not be able to process ore for the duration of the extension to April 12, citing a shortage of reagents. Mining and other activities would continue, and mined ore would be stockpiled until April 12, at which time the company anticipated resuming normal production levels, including milling at the mine. President and CEO Ricus Grimbeek said that Trevali had made modifications to the operations at Santander so that mining and ore stockpiling could continue. An additional 13 days have been added to the original 15-day state of national emergency in Peru, which restricts travel in efforts to contain the outbreak of Covid-19.
