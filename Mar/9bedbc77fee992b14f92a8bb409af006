Aim-listed Sunrise Resources on March 26 said it was making steady progress with the mine permitting process for its CS Pozzolan-Perlite project, in the US. The process is currently at a very advanced stage, the miner said, and all supplemental environmental reports have been accepted as completed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the environmental assessment (EA) report was being reviewed prior to release for public comment. The Nevada Division of Water Resources is currently reviewing the company’s change applications and the initial application is listed as ready for action. The company’s Class II Air Quality Operating Permit application to the Nevada Department of Environmental Protection has also been deemed administratively complete and is being processed. Once the EA is released, the public has 30 days to comment and, after responding to public comment, the BLM will issue its findings and, subsequently, a record of decision. Sunrise said that it was expecting a Finding of No Significant Impact, which would allow mining to proceed, subject to the issue of the State Reclamation Permit and the lodgement of the appropriate reclamation bond. Commenting on the current global situation surrounding the spread of Covid-19, Sunrise said its staff were working from home and that the company had initiated a business continuity plan ahead of the UK government’s initial advice on home working. This was not having, nor was it expected to have, any negative effect on the company’s business unless staff should become unwell, Sunrise said in its statement. Sunrise executive chairperson Patrick Cheetham added that the company was not in a position to give any forward guidance on the timing of future development; however, the company was “encouraged that the regulatory authorities were continuing to function” amid the outbreak of the virus.
