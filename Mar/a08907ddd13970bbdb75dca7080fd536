PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Coal miner New Hope Corporation has reported a 41% fall in profits after tax for the half year ended January, driven by lower coal prices. Profits for the six months under review declined from the A$120.2-million reported in the previous corresponding period, to A$69.7-million.. Revenue for the first half of A$618-million was in line with the previous corresponding period, despite a 33% increase in production on the previous corresponding period, reaching 6.2-million tonnes. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization for the first half of the year was down from A$285-million to A$213-million. “Bengalla continues to shine with production of 4.3-million tonnes of coal in the six months to January, an increase of 84% on the previous year,” said New Hope MD Shane Stephan. “This saw a corresponding lift in coal sales, both internationally and domestically with the company exporting 5.8-million tonnes, up 32% on the previous corresponding period and 0.6-million tonnes domestically, up 469% on the previous corresponding period.” Stephan said that at the current numbers, Bengalla was on track for another record year, however, second-half production would likely be lower due to the normal mine sequencing. At New Acland, in Queensland, the company was still awaiting state government approval for the Stage 3 expansion of the mine.
