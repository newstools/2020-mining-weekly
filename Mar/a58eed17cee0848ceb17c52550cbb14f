Canadian explorer and developer Giyani Metals has received final approval for the environmental management plan (EMP) from the Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA) in Botswana for its Lobatse manganese prospect. This was granted after the customary one-month public review process during which the company was required to advertise the details of the EMP in the Government Gazette and local newspapers. The public review process began on February 14 and concluded on March 13. There were no concerns raised by any stakeholders during that period and, as a result, the DEA issued an official acceptance letter on March 20. “We are extremely pleased with the final Lobatse EMP approval and grateful to the DEA in Botswana for the speed and dedication in which they have completed their review. "This is another great example of Botswana’s dedication to supporting its mining industry, especially as the country has introduced its own in-country restrictions following the Covid-19 global pandemic; measures we are both supporting in the country and applaud," says CEO Robin Birchall. He adds that the environmental framework required to proceed with exploration activities at Lobatse is now in place for Giyani to realise its full potential, including its efforts to expand the company’s manganese resource base in Botswana. This approval is the last of the three that the company has received across its K.Hill, Lobatse and Otse project sites.
