PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The Minerals Council of Australia (MCA) has called for the formation of a joint taskforce to assist in the re-employment of miners, after dual-listed gold miner Kirkland Lake announced plans to close two of its mines in the Northern Territory, telling 250 staff that their positions will be made redundant. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation on Wednesday reported that test mining and processing at the Cosmo mine and the Union Reefs processing plant would cease at the end of March. ASX- and TSX-listed Kirkland Lake has been working to restart operations at Cosmo, which was halted in 2017, and has been working through the approvals of an underground mine at the Union Reefs operation. However, Kirkland Lake said in a letter to staff that given the quality of the company’s other gold projects in Victoria and Canada, the Northern Territory projects were now designated as noncore. MCA executive director for the Northern Territory Drew Wagner said that a joint taskforce of industry, registered training organisations and government should be formed immediately to create pathways to employment across other sites and similar industries, including retraining to help Territory families stay here. He said that the Northern Territory government could also assist by accelerating project approvals, opening up the project pipeline and creating new jobs, after reports suggested that Kirkland Lake’s decision to place the two operations on the backburner came as a result of the territory government’s delay in processing mining approvals.
