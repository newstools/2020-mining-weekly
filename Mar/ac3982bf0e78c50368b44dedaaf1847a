Russian miner Alrosa has launched a digital tender for special size rough diamonds weighing more than 10.8 ct. The miner decided to cancel the upcoming special size auctions, simultaneously offering customers the opportunity to take part in a digital tender if they need rough diamonds. The digital tender allows customer to buy diamonds despite current travel restrictions imposed between countries owing to the Covid-19 pandemic. The digital tender will not replace the traditional trading model but is a solution for those who are working remotely. The digital tender is based on the technology that provides a customer with a full digital scan of each rough diamond for detailed analysis. In effect, this allows buyers to thoroughly evaluate the rough diamond and make informed purchasing decisions without needing to visit the companyâ€™s office. The auction takes place between March 23 and April 6.
