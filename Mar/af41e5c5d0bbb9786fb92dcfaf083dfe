Egypt-focused gold miner Centamin will postpone publishing its financial results for the 12 months ended December 31, in accordance with a request by the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The LSE- and TSX-listed miner said it would announce the new date of publication once it has been advised by the FCA on the updated timing. The changes come amid a time of global uncertainty as Covid-19 continues to spread across the world. Centamin on March 25 confirmed that, as of March 24, the miner had had no cases of Covid-19 among its workforce and had experienced “no material disruption to operations, supply chain or gold shipments”. This follows as the miner had taken early action at its Sukari operation, in Egypt, in line with its Severe Communicable Disease Outbreak Management Plan and the advice of governments and health authorities to cease non-essential travel, adjust and manage on-site rosters, while simultaneously enabling employees to work from home where possible and educating the workforce on the virus. As part of this plan, Centamin also ceased non-essential visitors, established mandatory checkpoints for possible symptoms and travel history screening for all visitors. “Measures are in place to ensure all countries in which our people are located follow the advice of local government and health authorities,” the miner said. A Covid-19 executive committee was also established with “a clear management and site support framework in place”, including daily workforce and supply chain risk reviews. Egypt has temporarily closed the national borders to civilian travel until April 15, but borders remain open to goods and supplies.
