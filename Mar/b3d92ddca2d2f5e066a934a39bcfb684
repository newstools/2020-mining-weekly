Gold mining company Kinross Gold has closed its Toronto office until at least next week Friday, to allow for a thorough cleaning and disinfection, after an employee tested positive for the Covid-19 virus. Kinross said on Wednesday that its employees would work from home until at least March 20, when the need for the closure would be re-evaluated. On Wednesday, the World Health Organisation declared the coronavirus outbreak, which has spread to at least 114 countries, a pandemic. It has also emerged that a person from Sudbury, who attended the Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada (PDAC) Convention in Toronto earlier this month, has tested positive for Covid-19. About 23 100 people attended the PDAC Convention, from March 1 to 4, including Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Meanwhile, Kinross pointed out that it had established a Covid-19 task force earlier this year, with input from expert medical and travel advisers. These plans include increased travel restrictions, individual site management controls and screening to control access to mine sites, emergency medical preparedness, supply chain contingency plans, and working with health authorities to closely monitor local and global developments. “To date, Covid-19 has not impacted production or product shipments at any of the company’s sites. Nor, to date, has there been any significant negative impact on, or disruption of, the company’s supply chain. Nonetheless, Kinross is constantly monitoring the situation and is working with its critical suppliers, who the company understands have mitigation plans in place, to minimise any potential supply chain disruptions that might emerge,” said the miner in a statement.
