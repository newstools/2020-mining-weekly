Platinum group metals (PGMs) and chrome concentrate miner Tharisa has shut its PGMs smelter, thereby placing it on care and maintenance, as well as declared force majeure on its contracted chrome concentrate sales agreements. The miner has also received force majeure notifications from its PGM concentrate offtakers. These decisions are the result of a national lockdown enforced to curb the spread of Covid-19, with the majority of non-essential miners having to close shop around the country, and worldwide. The national lockdown is effective for 21 days, from March 27 to April 16. Tharisa said in a statement on March 27 that it remains fully supportive of the government’s initiative in dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic and will implement all measures as instructed by the government.
