West Africa-focused gold company Cora Gold has started a 2 000 m reverse circulation (RC) drilling programme at its Madina Foulbé permit, in eastern Senegal, to test mineralisation at depth. The project is located within the prolific Kedougou-Kenieba Inlier gold region, which has, historically, seen over 50-million ounces of gold discovered. Commenting in a March 30 statement, CEO Bert Monro said this was the first time Cora was drilling within this permit area. He added that the company would be keeping its costs and carbon footprint down at the camp, and that a small solar hybrid power system had been installed. Additionally, considering the global Covid-19 pandemic, Cora stated that it was currently continuing exploration programmes at this time, but averred that it had adapted operations appropriately.
