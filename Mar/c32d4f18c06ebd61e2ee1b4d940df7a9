Acquisitions company Mining, Minerals & Metals (MMM) has listed on the LSE. The company was established to undertake acquisitions of businesses that are involved in natural resources exploration. Investment and advisory firm, Moshe Capital, is a founding shareholder in MMM and its two directors serve on the board alongside directors from New York and London. “The listing of MMM is significant as a vehicle to raise capital for reverse takeover opportunities in mining, as well as oil and gas investments. We are actively exploring a pipeline of potential investments both on the African continent and elsewhere,” said Moshe founder and CEO Mametja Moshe in a statement issued on Wednesday. There will be no minimum acquisition size prescribed and acquisitions will vary, based on value and expected rates of return. Both wholly-owned assets and joint venture opportunities will be considered.
