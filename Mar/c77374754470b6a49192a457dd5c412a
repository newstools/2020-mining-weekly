ASX-listed Amani Gold has substantially upgraded the mineral resource estimate of its Kebigada gold deposit to 124-million tonnes, grading 1.03 g/t gold for 4.1-million ounces. The deposit is part of the Giro gold project, in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The new estimate represents a 28%, or 800 000 oz, increase in contained gold compared with the prior estimate, which was 75-million tonnes, grading 1.18 g/t gold for 2.9-million ounces. The company is still undertaking exploration work at the Giro project to continue expanding the project scale. A campaign of 6 000 m core drilling along strike is planned to start in May or June. The Kebigada deposit’s mineral resource estimate has 59% of the resource in the indicated category and 41% in the inferred category. “Kebigada remains open at depth along the entire strike of the orebody. We believe we have a major gold deposit at Giro and Amani now has a solid resource base to move closer towards becoming a significant gold producer in Africa,” says technical director Grant Thomas.
