PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Diversified major BHP has launched an $8-million plan to help mitigate the spread of Covid-19 in Chile. The company over the weekend announced that it had combined efforts with the medical faculty of the Universidad Católica, to raise the testing capacity and strengthen the Familiar Health Centers of the South East Area of the Metropolitan Region, as well as Antofagasta and Tarapacá. This plan includes an early detection programme through rapid testing, in support of Primary Attention Centers, the expansion of laboratory capacity, including the purchasing of new analysis equipment to maximize the speed for processing tests, community surveillance for cases that test positive and their contacts, based at Primary Attention Centers and telemedicine, and a 24/7 call center for identifying potential cases. “This plan shows our commitment and our profound belief that we should work together to face the difficult times we are going through,” said BHP’s president for operations at Minerals America, Daniel Malchuk. In addition, BHP will also implement a programme to support communities and high-risk, vulnerable groups in the regions where the company operates, Antofagasta and Tarapacá. This will allow the delivery of supplies, sanitization of public areas, areas for the isolation of potential cases and support to the state network to increase medical rounds, supplies and treatment for high-risk people.
