PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Dual-listed gold miner OceanGold has temporarily suspended operations at its Waihi gold mine, on the North Island of New Zealand, four a four-week mandated closure. The ASX- and TSX-listed miner has also temporarily suspended the ongoing development of the Martha underground mine, after New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern earlier this week announced that all non-essential services or lifeline utilities would be closed for an initial four week period as the country moved to curb the spread of COVID-19. OceanaGold said on Tuesday that it was working with the New Zealand government to determine what exemptions could be available for the Macraes operation, on the South Island. “We recognize strong decisions will be made to slow down the spread of COVID-19. We will work with the government to support the health and safety of the communities where we work and live,” said OceanaGold acting president and CEO Michael Holmes.
