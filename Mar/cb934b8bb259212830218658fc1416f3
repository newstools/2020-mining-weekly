London- and TSX-listed SolGold has reduced its mining operations throughout Ecuador, heeding a call made by the country’s Emergency Operations Committee of a “stay at home” policy. The policy has resulted in the temporary closure of businesses across the country. In an effort to reduce the transmission of Covid-19, SolGold is actively monitoring its employees and will continue to do so for the next 14 days. The company has also reduced its working staff to essential personnel only. “'Where possible, the company's geologists, administration, technical and financial teams are working from home and will continue to progress SolGold's projects using the extensive database. “The Alpala prefeasibility study is continuing externally, using the available information which has already been substantially gathered from site," company secretary Karl Schlobohm says. As the situation is dependent on actions at regional, state, national and international levels, SolGold cannot currently indicate the duration of the temporary partial suspension of field work on the company's projects.
