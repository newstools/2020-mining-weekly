Owing to public health restrictions on the movement of people and products in Botswana, South Africa and India, diamond miner De Beers will not hold its third rough diamond sales cycle of this year. As a result, De Beers is enabling sightholders to defer 100% of their Sight 3 allocations to later in the year. The miner intends to “seek innovative ways” to meet rough diamond supply needs in the coming weeks. De Beers usually has ten sales cycles a year.
