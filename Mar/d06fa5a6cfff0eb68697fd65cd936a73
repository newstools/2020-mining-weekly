NYSE- and TSX-listed gold and base metal producer Newmont Corporation has scheduled a virtual annual general meeting on April 21 in light of global Covid-19 social distancing practices. The virtual meeting complements other measures implemented at Newmontâ€™s operations and offices globally to protect the health and safety of its workforce and neighbouring communities. Newmont, however, expects the virtual format of its meetings to only be necessary for this year and will revert back to in-person annual meetings in future.
