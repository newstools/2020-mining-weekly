Operations management consultancy DuPont Sustainable Solutions (DSS) has acquired the assets of Toronto-based consultancy Lodestone Partners, effective end-February. This will deepen DSS’ knowledge and capability in the area of operations excellence in the natural resource and mining industry, owing to Lodestone being recognised for helping companies in the resource industry achieve sustainable improvements in operating performance. “Combining Lodestone’s highly respected operational improvement expertise with DSS’ risk management capabilities will now enable us to deliver an integrated operations transformation capability that is not currently available in the marketplace,” says DSS regional director Johan van der Westhuyzen. “This acquisition significantly expands DSS’ ability to help our clients protect their people and improve operations and is a significant step forward in our strategy to accelerate growth in select geographies and industries since becoming an independent company in September,” he adds. Lodestone Partners is based in Toronto, Canada and has worked at clients’ operations around the globe, including Canada, the US, Australia, South Africa and Saudi Arabia. Its clients include many of the world’s largest resource companies, as well as commodity-specific midtier mining companies. Robin Schleich, former director of Lodestone Partners, has assumed the new role of director for operations excellence practice within DSS. The addition of Lodestone partners’ experienced senior consultants means that DSS will now have more than 900 consultants operating out of 40 offices globally. “We are excited to join with DSS and contribute an enhanced operations excellence offering to the portfolio of services DSS offers to its clients,” says Schleich.
