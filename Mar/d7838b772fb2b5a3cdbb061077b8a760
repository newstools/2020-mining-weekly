PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Strike Resources has tipped Utah Point, at Port Hedland, as the preferred port destination for its Paulsens East iron-ore project, in Western Australia. A trade-off study focused on Port Hedland, which has existing infrastructure that could be used to bring Paulsens East into production, identified Utah Point as the preferred destination. Utah Point offers a number of commercial advantages, Strike said on Wednesday, including a further simplified and de-risked operational process with direct mine-to-port product distribution, minimisation of product double handing, a reduction in capital requirements, accommodation for larger vessel sizes, and potential to upscale production in excess of the planned 1.5-million tonnes a year to take advantage of the strong iron-ore market. The Pilbara Ports Authority has confirmed capacity availability for Strike’s planned operation, the company added. “The availability of suitable capacity at Utah Point now provides Strike with a choice of logistics solutions for Paulsens East, further de-risking the project,” said Strike MD William Johnson. “The mine-to-port logistics chain for Utah Point is much simpler than for Onslow, with less double handling of ore and no transshipment required. Being already an established multi-user iron-ore export port with available capacity and existing ship-loading facilities provides further advantages. “As we advance our project studies, Strike will, however, continue to evaluate both port options and maintain maximum project flexibility.” Strike is currently updating its scoping study to detail the economic impact of using the Utah Point, with the company still targeting first iron-ore shipments by the fourth quarter of this year.
