PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The Gippsland Basin joint venture (JV) between heavyweight BHP and ExxonMobil Australia, is expected to deliver more gas into the Australian domestic market by next year. Exxon subsidiary Esso Australia has reached total depth on the first of its two West Barracouta gas wells, in the Bass Strait, offshore Victoria, with gas expected to be flowing to the market by early 2021. The West Barracouta wells will be tied back to the existing Barracouta infrastructure offshore in Bass Strait. “After more than 50 years, the Gippsland Basin JV continues to be a crucial source of gas supply for the nation and is the largest supplier of gas to the eastern Australia market,” said ExxonMobil Australia chairperson Nathan Fay. “Since drilling the first Bass Strait well in 1965, our operations have delivered more than four-billion barrels of oil and 10-trillion cubic feet of natural gas to Australia. This is more than half of all the oil ever produced in Australia, and enough gas to power almost every home in Australia for a decade. “Esso Australia continues to focus on delivering gas that Australians need to the domestic market.” The new project builds on more than $5.5-billion invested by the Gippsland Basin JV in other recent Victorian projects supplying gas for Australians, including the Kipper Tuna Turrum offshore project and the Longford Gas Conditioning Plant. “We are proud to continue our long history of investment in the Gippsland basin where, along with our joint venture partner BHP, we have been powering Australian homes and businesses for more than five decades,” said Fay.
