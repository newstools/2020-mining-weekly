PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Services provider MACA has been awarded a A$38-million public road upgrade and access road works at the Corunna Downs iron-ore project, in Western Australia. The contract will stretch over a period of eight months, and will include the upgrade of a 22-km section of public road and the development of a 13-km access road, with the contract employing 80 people at peak. Work on the contract will start in the June quarter of this year. “MACA is delighted to have been awarded these early civil works for Atlas Iron, demonstrating the civil capability within our end-to-end mining service offering. We look forward to being part of the successful development of the Corunna Downs and continuing our long-standing relationship with Atlas,” said MACA CEO Mike Sutton. The Corunna Downs openpit project is expected to produce 23.3-million tonnes over a six-year period, at an average rate of around four-million tonnes a year. A 2016 prefeasibility study estimated that the project would require a capital investment of between A$47-million and A$53-million, and would have C1 cash costs of between A$37/t and A$43/t.
