PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Underground mining services provider Barminco is set to break into the Canadian market with the award of an underground mining contract from gold miner Barrick at its Hemlo mine, in Ontario. ASX-listed Perenti on Monday reported that Barminco had received a letter of intent from Barrick. Under the proposed three-year, A$200-milllion mining services contract, Barminco would support Barrick’s goal to modernise and improve the performance of the Hemlo mine, and to establish the operation as a tier two asset within the Barrick group. Barminco will undertake mine development, production and haulage using mining equipment provided by Barrick. The contractor will employ more than 300 staff at the operation, with work expected to start in April. “This is Barminco’s and Perenti’s first significant contract in North America and builds on our regional growth capabilities, after expanding into Botswana last year with an A$800-million contract,” said Perenti MD Mark Norwell.
