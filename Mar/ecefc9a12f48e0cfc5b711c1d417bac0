ASX- and TSX-V-listed Jervois Mining has suspended its activities in Uganda in response to Covid-19, with no fixed  remobilisation date yet. The miner said on Friday that measures have been undertaken to safeguard the health and safety of its employees, contractors and local communities. According to Jervois, timing of restart will “depend on the ability to reactive field operations in a safe and responsible manner and broader market conditions”. Meanwhile, it also reported on Friday that its 2019 and 2020 drill programmes at its Kilembe and Bujagali area properties had yielded an additional seven holes of drilling. Drilling at Kilembe represented 1 905 m of diamond drilling across 17 holes in 2019, and another four holes in 2020, representing an additional 466 m of drilling. Fourteen drill holes were reported in January 2020. Groundwork at the Kilembe area, including ground geophysics, soil and rock chip sampling, and prospecting have extended the strike length of mineralisation at the surface to more than six kilometres, if which only 1.5 km has been tested. These results, Jervois said on Friday, continue to expand the prospective areas and improve understanding of mineralisation at the Ugandan properties and are currently being used to prepare future field plans.
