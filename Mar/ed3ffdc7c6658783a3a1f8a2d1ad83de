JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) – Platinum group metals (PGMs) mining and marketing company Anglo American Platinum (Amplats) on Friday shut its entire explosion-hit Anglo Converter Plant (ACP) chain of processing facilities and declared a force majeure. The company’s ACP phase A converter plant, at the Waterval smelter in Rustenburg, was damaged following an explosion within the converter on February 10 and then the detection of water in the furnace of the phase B unit as it was ramping up to steady state to take over from the damaged phase A plant. Repair work on phase A is expected to be completed by the second quarter of 2021 and water in the phase B unit’s furnace has had to be shut to avoid a catastrophic event. It is anticipated that the repair works to fix the phase B unit will take 80 days, the JSE-listed company said in a release to Mining Weekly. As a result of the temporary closure of the entire ACP, Amplats has had to declare force majeure to customers, suppliers of third-party purchase of concentrate and suppliers of tolling material, as it is unable to complete the processing of material during the converter repair. Production from Amplats’ own mines, as well as third party material, will not be able to be converted to refined production while the ACP is undergoing repairs, even though concentrate from the mines will continue to be smelted at one of the four smelter complexes.
