The World Federation of Diamond Bourses (WFDB) has created a World Federation Diamond Trading Platform to provide a secure and reliable source of trading amid uncertain times globally, while promoting trade and healthy competition in the diamond market. The cross-bourse trading platform will be launched soon and will be available for use by all members of the organisation’s bourses. The organisation has 30 affiliated bourse members and exists to protect the interests of affiliated bourses and their individual members, while arbitrating disputes between individual members or affiliated bourses. “The platform will give members peace of mind as every transaction will be protected by the WFDB’s unparalleled and unique arbitration system. “In these times of uncertainty, the dependability, security and reliability of the WFDB’s arbitration system has never been more crucial and we hope this new platform will help expand this system to modern trading methods,” president Ernie Blom says. He adds that the unprecedented crisis that is the Covid-19 pandemic has made it clear that all of the WFDB’s members globally are intimately linked. “If there is any silver lining and benefit to Covid-19, it has taught us that we must all come together to promote and facilitate the diamond trade in order for members of every bourse to trade freely with one another and to feel safe while doing so,” Blom notes.
