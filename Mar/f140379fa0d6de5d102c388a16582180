PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The Minerals Commission of Ghana has approved the resettlement action plan (RAP) for ASX-listed Cardinal Resources’ Namindi gold project. The RAP included concrete structures such as residential and public housing, a healthcare facility, two schools, teacher’s accommodation and three religious venues, and will be used by the Environmental Protection Agency to support the environmental impact study for the Namindi project. Cardinal was granted a water extraction permit earlier this year for Namindi, allowing the ASX-listed company to extract water from the White Volta river for mining and processing pruposes and from boreholes within the mining license area for mine construction and development purposes. CEO and MD Archie Koimtsidis said that the approval of the RAP would assist the company in rapidly and successfully developing Namidi. “Once again there is clear demonstration of continued support, not only locally for the project development, but also from the Ghana government,” he said. Cardinal is hoping to complete the RAP by the third quarter of this year, completing advanced front-end engineering and design by the fourth quarter of this year, with the aim of starting production at Namindi in the second half of 2022. An October feasibility study into the project estimated that it would produce some 4.2-million ounces of gold over a mine life of 15 years, with an estimated 1.1-million ounces expected over the first three years of the operation. Namindi is expected to cost $390-million to develop.
