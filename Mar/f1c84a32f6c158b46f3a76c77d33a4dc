PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Junior Saturn Metals will raise nearly A$3-million in share placement to fund exploration and resource definition at its Apollo Hill gold project, in Western Australia. The placement will consist of 10.98-million new shares, priced at 27c each, and will be placed under Saturn’s existing placement capacity. “This successful raising has put the company in a great position as we seek to test our exciting new concepts and follow up on the best intersections ever seen across the Apollo Hill project,” said Saturn MD Ian Bamborough. “High grades in the hanging wall at Apollo Hill, and now across the broader camp, are offering an exciting opportunity for next level discovery. With a strong balance sheet, a robust resource base from which to grow, and exciting new targets to test, I look forward to the results flow and a prosperous future for Saturn Metals.”
