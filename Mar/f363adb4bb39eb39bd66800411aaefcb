PERTH (miningweekly.com) â€“ Copper miner Sandfire Resources is undertaking business as usual while continuing to implement protocols to minimise the potential transmission of Covid-19. The ASX-listed miner on Thursday said that its DeGrussa operations, in Western Australia, continued to operate at full capacity, with mining, processing and concentrate sales figures in line with guidance. Studies to optimise the proposed T3 mine, in Botswana, also continued, along with exploration at the A4 discovery, while the approvals process for the Black Butte copper project, in the US, also continued ahead of a determination of the mine operating permit and record of decision, in parallel with the feasibility study. However, Sandfire told shareholders that the company was continuously monitoring and planning for the potential impact of Covid-19 on its operations. The company said that it was not in a position to reliably measure or predict the impact that the pandemic would have on the production and costs at the DeGrussa project, or on the timing of decisions and the development pipeline at Tshukudu and Black Butte.
