Canadian junior Star Diamond on Thursday started legal proceedings against Rio Tinto Exploration Canada (RTEC) to protect its interest in the Star-Orion South project, in Saskatchewan. Star Diamond last month flagged possible legal action over RTECâ€™s purported exercise in November 2019 of its four options under the option and joint venture agreement of June 2017, claiming that it did not comply with the terms of the agreement. Exercising the four options would give RTEC a 60% interest in the Star-Orion project.
