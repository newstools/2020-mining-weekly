PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association (Appea) and the Australian Pipelines and Gas Association (APGA) on Friday said that their members were working to ensure the delivery of essential gas supply to local customers amid the Covid-19 outbreak. Appea CEO Andrew McConville and APGA CEO Steve Davies confirmed members were taking all steps necessary to ensure the production and delivery of gas supplies continued. “Our industry provides vital energy resources to millions of Australian homes, businesses and public facilities,” McConville said. “It’s essential we continue to do so and, accordingly, we are treating the operational challenges posed by Covid-19 very seriously.” Davies said the upstream and pipeline industries had robust operational integrity measures in place at all times, but were vigilant to the additional challenges posed by Covid-19. “We are ensuring good information flows and open channels of communication as they are absolutely essential elements of the response in this rapidly changing situation,” Davies said. “We are continuously monitoring the situation and are taking appropriate precautions to ensure the energy we need in our homes, commerce and industry is delivered.” McConville said the economic contribution of Australia’s oil and gas industry was also vital as other parts of the economy are severely constrained by the impacts of Covid-19. “The oil and gas industry underpins around 80 000 direct and indirect jobs – and hundreds of thousands of Australian jobs rely on the reliable, affordable and sustainable supply of oil and gas. “The resilience of our business is essential in maintaining the broader health of our economy and is our key focus during this challenging period.”
