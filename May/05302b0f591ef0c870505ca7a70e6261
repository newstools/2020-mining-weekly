Engineering company Fluor South Africa has reached a safety milestone of two-million hours worked without a lost-time injury at Cupric Canyon Capital's Khoemacau copper/silver starter project, in Botswana. Fluor was awarded the engineering, procurement and construction management contract for all the surface infrastructure for Khoemacau in 2019. The project is expected to produce a yearly average of 62 000 t of copper and 1.9-million ounces of silver with a life-of-mine in excess of 20 years. “This significant safety achievement can be attributed to the team’s commitment to safe work practices and a zero harm mindset for everyone to go home safe and healthy every day. "This milestone was reached over a period of eight months with a peak workforce of over 1 700,” said Fluor South Africa project director Jim Picken.
