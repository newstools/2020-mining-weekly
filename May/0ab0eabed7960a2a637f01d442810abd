AltX- and Aim-listed Jubilee Metals has successfully completed the commissioning of its cobalt production line to complement the copper refinery and sulphuric acid plant at the Kabwe Sable refinery, in Zambia. This while all of its platinum group metal and chrome operations in South Africa have resumed operations following the national lockdown. With all of the company’s operations being surface-based processing facilities, they lend themselves to a rapid ramp-up to targeted throughputs. CEO Leon Coetzer says that, at all of Jubilee’s operations the safety of staff remains a priority. The company is implementing strict health and security measures on site, as subscribed by the authorities. “I am also pleased with the progress we are making in Zambia where we were able to successfully bring the copper and cobalt refining streams on-line to continue with the implementation and expansion of our multi-metal refining capacity at the Kabwe Sable Refinery. “The construction of the zinc recovery circuit remains on hold, owing to current restrictions, and we will continue to update shareholders as the situation changes,” he adds.
