PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Junior NTM Gold has reported a maiden inferred mineral resource of 89 300 t, grading 4.9 g/t gold for 140 800 oz of contained gold at its Hub deposit, in Western Australia. The mineral resource estimate includes oxide, transitional and fresh material, the company added, with the oxide component making up around 30% of the resource ounces. “The maiden mineral resource estimate for Hub is an important outcome for the company following its discovery in October 2018. Significantly, the Hub deposit remains open at strike and depth,” said NTM Gold MD Andrew Muir. “The high-grade nature of Hub highlights the deposit’s potential value, particularly the oxide material with a grade of 6.6 g/t, which starts from surface. With the recent excellent leach results that have an average of 96% recovery, the mineralisation at Hub represents a key value driver for the company.” The global mineral resource at the Redcliffe project, of which Hub forms part, now stands at 679 000 oz.
