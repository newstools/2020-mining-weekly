JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) – Diversified mining company Anglo American, while committing to upholding the legacy its historic central business district (CBD) presence in downtown Johannesburg, has decided to relocate its Johannesburg CBD colleagues to a new consolidated corporate office in Rosebank, north of the city centre, next year. Anglo American group external communication manager Sibusiso Tshabalala outlined to Mining Weekly that the company had been exploring options to bring all of its South African corporate offices together in one location to support its future workplace strategy – which is based on creating a workplace that is safe, smart and collaborative. Following an extensive process of consultation with employees, and an assessment of various options, Tshabalala said that the London- and Johannesburg-listed Anglo American had decided to move its Johannesburg CBD campus colleagues to 144 Oxford Street, Rosebank, in 2021. “We’ve engaged extensively over the past year, discussing not only where we work, but how we can work better together to cement our high-performance culture and to offer all possible opportunities for employees and their professional development. “Our immediate focus right now is on protecting the wellbeing and health of our employees during the Covid-19 pandemic and we’ll provide further updates on our move  at the appropriate time,” Tshabalala said “In the interim, most of our corporate office employees in South Africa continue to work from home, in line with the guidance provide by government under the Covid-19 regulations. “As a leading global mining company, with significant presence in South Africa, we’re committed to attracting the best people and ensuring that they thrive, in the context of a changing workplace environment. “We’re proud of our contribution to the Johannesburg CBD. While we’ve been here for many decades, it’s critical for us to consider the need for modern infrastructure and a safe working environment for our people. “We’re very much aware of the importance of the CBD, and our legacy in it, and we’ll ensure that the buildings can support the development of the inner city – and build on our positive legacy in South Africa,” Tshabalala said.
