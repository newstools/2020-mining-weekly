PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The Western Australian Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) has granted potash developer Australian Potash consent to proceed with minor and preliminary works at its Lake Wells sulphide of potash (SoP) project, while the environmental review process continues. “Our team has been working very closely with the EPA to ensure all aspects of the proposed Lake Wells SoP development meet or exceed required standards for the protection of the broader environment at Lake Wells. The environmental review document is now at Stage 3 of the four-stage EPA assessment process,” said Australian Potash MD and CEO Matt Shackleton. “Concurrently, the company applied to proceed with what are referred to as minor and preliminary works. The EPA is willing to grant this approval ahead of its recommendations to the Minister for Environment on the full development, when a company can demonstrate responsible, recoverable and minimal impact on the environment, of these works.” The minor and preliminary works subject to the consent will include upgrading the camp access track, constructing and maintaining the western borefield track, the pond perimeter track and the eastern borefield track, building a construction village, and developing several borrow areas to source material from. The A$208-million Lake Wells SoP project could deliver 150 000 t/y of SoP, based on the maiden reserve of 3.6-million tonnes, and will have a mine life of 30 years.
