TSX- and JSE-listed Eastern Platinum (Eastplats) has started recalling its remaining workforce in Mpumalanga, South Africa, after South Africa moved from Phase 5 lockdown restrictions to Phase 4 restrictions, effective May 1. Eastplats’ subsidiary, Barplats Mines, operates a tailings retreatment project at the Crocodile River mine, which had been operating care-and-maintenance activities at reduced capacity and with a small workforce during Phase 5. The company says it continues to monitor and update its risk assessments and has adopted appropriate procedures to maintain a safe workplace for employees and the communities in which it operates. Eastplats is still considering an appropriate time and format for its annual general meeting. “The effects of Covid-19 are changing and evolving and the company cannot reasonably estimate at this time all the impacts or if new or unexpected changes to the lockdown levels imposed by the South African government will occur, both of which could have material adverse effects on Eastplats’ business, liquidity and cashflows,” the company states. Meanwhile, the company will publish its financial statements for the three months ended March 31 on June 1, making use of the extended allowance for regulatory filings.
