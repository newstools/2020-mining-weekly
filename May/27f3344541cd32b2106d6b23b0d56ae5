Diversified miner Glencore has announced that its annual general meeting (AGM) will be held on June 2. However, owing to Covid-19 restrictions, it will be a closed meeting and shareholders will not be able to physically attend. Instead, shareholders will be able to participate in the business of the meeting by voting by proxy. Glencore will host a live audio webcast on May 28 where questions can be asked ahead of the AGM.
