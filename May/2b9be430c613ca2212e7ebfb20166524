PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Rare earths miner Lynas on Monday restarted operations in Malaysia, after the government announced that nearly all economic sectors, including manufacturing, would be allowed to resume operations, as measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19 are relaxed. The company told shareholders that the plant would be restarted at approximately 70% of the NEXT production rates, enabling Lynas to refill supply chains and to restock depleted inventories of critical materials, while maintaining new health and hygiene protocols at each site. “Our number one priority will continue to be the health and safety of our people and our local communities,” the company said, adding that it had already implemented strict health and hygiene protocols at both its sites that will comply with federal and state government requirements. The Mt Weld operation, in Western Australia, will continue to operate with reduced staff on site, and with health and hygiene protocols that comply with government guidelines.
