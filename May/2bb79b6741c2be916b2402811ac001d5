LSE-listed Kavango Resources has announced the next stages of exploration in the Kalahari Suture Zone (KSZ) in Botswana. The exploration objectives are to discover world-class copper/nickel/platinum group metal (PGM) deposits in the KSZ; to identify high-potential drill targets in "underground traps"; and to increase the chances of future drilling success. Ongoing data analysis work in the second and third quarters will include the completion of a three-dimensional underground geological model of the northern part of the KSZ. Field work and sample collection is set to start once the Covid-19-related lockdown in Botswana is over. This includes a whole rock geochemistry report on gabbro samples; "thin section" drill core samples to be sent to the University of Leicester's laboratory for mineralogical and petrographic testing; and ground-based, high-powered electromagnetic loop surveys to confirm final drill targets. "Over the coming months, we expect to make significant progress in validating our view that the underexplored KSZ is host to world-class copper/nickel/PGM deposits. "All our efforts to date have consistently confirmed the KSZ's significant potential. Our goal now is to deepen our understanding of the region's geology and to confirm our next targets for field exploration,” says CEO Michael Foster. The analyses that the company is now completing will guide preparations for its next extensive drill campaign and maximise its chances of success, he notes. “I look forward to providing further updates on the results of our work, including a future drilling timetable once complete."
