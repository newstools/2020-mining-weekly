Canada-based intermediate gold miner Torex said on Thursday that it planned to resume full production at its El Limón Guajes mining complex, in Mexico, by the end of this month. The company noted that it had continued active engagement with local communities during the national suspension of nonessential businesses and that members had encouraged the miner to restart operations “as quickly as possible". “With the government lifting the suspension decree for mining as of May 18, mobilization for a full restart of operations will begin immediately,” said president and CEO Fred Standford. The processing plant will continue to treat low grade stockpile material for the remainder of May. By that time, the crews will have ramped up the mining operations, and the plant will begin processing regular mine grade material. June is expected to be a routine production month. “We are glad to be back,” said Standford.
