PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Consolidated Zinc has applied to be exempted from the Mexican government’s decision to suspend all non-essential services until the end of May in zones where Covid-19 cases have been identified. The miner on Wednesday said that the Aldama zone, where its process plant and the Plomosas mine were located, had just reported its first case of Covid-19, meaning that the time at which the ban will be lifted in the region has changed from mid-May to the end of May. Consolidated Zinc has applied for an exemption from the ban, citing the remote location of its Plomosas mine and the Aldama plant. The company told shareholders that it was still awaiting a ruling from the state health authority and the state Mines Department. Meanwhile, key personnel have been retained at the sites while all other staff have been sent home, while safety measures have been implemented for all personnel working.
