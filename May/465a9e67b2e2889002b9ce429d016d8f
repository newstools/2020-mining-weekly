PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Major Rio Tinto has revealed more than 300 vacancies within its Western Australian iron-ore business, with the miner continuing its recruitment for skilled roles, apprentices, graduates and Aboriginal trainees. The miner this week noted that the available roles included skilled operational and maintenance roles such as frontline supervisors, experienced operators of excavators, haul trucks and graders as well as experienced maintenance staff such as heavy diesel fitters. The roles are a mix of fly-in, fly-out from Perth and the company’s regional hubs in Western Australia as well as residential positions in Perth and the Pilbara. “Throughout this challenging period we are committed to keeping our people and our communities safe and supporting Western Australians with employment opportunities to help deliver on our plan to invest A$10-billion in the Pilbara over the next three years. This will help ensure we can continue to operate while making a strong contribution to the State and national economies,” said Rio iron-ore CEO Chris Salisbury. He noted that Rio was maintaining its commitment to the development of skills for the future through the hiring of around 160 apprentices, graduates and Aboriginal trainees from the Pilbara, Perth and other regional centres. The 2020 intake of apprentices and graduates is up 25% from last year with gender diversity also significantly increased.
