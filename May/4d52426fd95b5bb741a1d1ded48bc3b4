PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Gold developer Bardoc Gold is hoping to start production at its namesake project, in Western Australia, by the third quarter of next year. A definitive feasibility study for the three-million-ounce Bardoc gold project is currently under way, and targeted for completion by the first quarter of 2021. Bardoc on Tuesday said that the company is working on securing concentrate offtake agreements by the fourth quarter of this year, and environmental approvals by the first quarter of 2021, while project financing completion is targeted for the third quarter of 2021, ahead of the start of mining and project construction. A prefeasibility study (PFS) into the project previously found that the Bardoc project could produce 135 000 oz/y over a seven-year mine life, with the project requiring a capital investment of A$142.4-million. “In light of the outstanding success of the recent PFS, we have moved quickly to appoint key consultants, corporate and strategic partners to help us develop a detailed timeframe to bring the Bardoc gold project into production as quickly as possible,” said Bardoc CEO Robert Ryan. “There are now a number of key de-risking milestones that will allow investors to track the progress of the company over the coming months. These include a mineral resource update in the third quarter, the completion of an agreement for the sale of our gold concentrate in the fourth quarter, and the completion of final environmental permitting and the delivery of a final definitive feasibility study in the first quarter of 2021.”
