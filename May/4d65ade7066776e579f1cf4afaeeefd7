Two employees from the Tucano gold mine, in northern Brazil, have tested positive for Covid-19, TSX- and NYSE American-listed Great Panther said on Thursday. The employees have mild symptoms and are in isolation at home. The company noted that operations at the mine had not been impacted and that it continued to operate at full capacity with mitigation protocols in place. Great Panther said that there were no other confirmed or suspected cases at its Mexican operations or its Coricancha mine, in Peru, that continue complying with temporary government-mandated restrictions. In Mexico, the miner will start ramping up its Topia mine on May 18 and the Guanajuato mine complex from May 30. In Peru, mining companies had beenÂ allowed to return to operating activities as of May 2, in four phases, adding one phase monthly. The Coricancha mine falls within the category of mining operations allowed to resume operating activities in July. In the first quarter of 2020, the company undertook a limited mining and mill processing campaign of about 25 000 t; however, these activities were temporarily suspended following the federal government-mandated restrictions and will be potentially rescheduled towards the end of the third quarter. The Coricancha mine is on care and maintenance and is not material to the company's operations.
