Precious metals miner Hochschild Mining has met all the requirements to restart operations in Peru, and is aiming to achieve full production in the coming weeks. The London-listed mining company said on Monday it would begin ramping up progressively at the Inmaculada and Pallancata mines. "We intend to execute a disciplined remobilisation of our workforce in line with the prescribed health protocols and guidelines from the government. In these unprecedented times, we continue to prioritise the health and wellbeing of our employees and of the communities in which we operate,‚Äù said CEO Ignacio Bustamante. The San Jose mine, in southern Argentina, recently restarted operations and is following a phased ramp-up process. Hochschild said it would reissue its full-year guidance once full production was achieved and the overall impact of the suspensions was clear. In line with current government guidelines, the company's brownfield exploration programme is expected to recommence in July.
