West Africa-focused gold company Cora Gold has appointed international environmental consultants Digby Wells Environmental to undertake the environmental- and social-impact assessment (Esia) for its Sanankoro project in the Yanfolila gold belt, in southern Mali. The collection of baseline data for the Esia has already commenced, the aim of which is to ascertain specialist studies, ranging from ecological, water and social studies, a conceptual closure and rehabilitation plan, a stakeholder engagement process, a resettlement policy framework and a community development plan. Cora continues to advance Sanankoro, for which a scoping study has estimated an 84% internal rate of return at a gold price of $1 400/oz. The company is initially focused on resource growth and then, if successful, the delivery of a definitive feasibility study (DFS) before the end of 2021. Cora Gold CEO Bert Monro says the Esia is critical to the success of the DFS, which the company is focused on completing before the end of 2021, following further exploration. “As we look further ahead to transitioning from explorer to developer, [the Esia] will support our future exploitation permit application.” Cora previously worked with Digby Wells to complete an initial environmental and social screening study in 2019 as part of Sanankoro’s scoping study. In terms of permitting, Cora notes that although the Sanankoro exploration permit expired on February 1, in accordance with Mali's Mining Code, the company had, prior to its expiry, submitted an application for the award of a new permit over the area covered by the Sanankoro permit. Cora says the new permit will be announced in due course, once the necessary process set out in the Mining Code has occurred.
