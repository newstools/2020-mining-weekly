PERTH (miningweekly.com) â€“ Mining operations have restarted at the Mt Garnet base metals project and the Dry River South mine, in Queensland, have resumed operations. ASX-listed Consolidated Tin Mines in March this year halted operations and placed its Mt Garnet and Surveyor projects on care-and-maintenance, and employees stood down without pay, as a measure to contain the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. The company on Wednesday along with mining activities resuming, the Mt Garnet concentrator has also resumed operations and would be operating on the basis of eight days on and six days off, with campaign processing. The underground operations at Mt Garnet will remain on care and maintenance until further notice. Consolidated Tin noted that employees that were stood down will be progressively returned to work, but noted that not all employees would be reinstated in the short-term, due to only one mine operating and the concentrator not running at full capacity.
