Unionised employees at Canadian gold miner Kinross Gold’s Tasiast mine, in Mauritania, have initiated strike action. Kinross, who disagrees with the basis for the strike, on May 5 said that it remained open to discussions with the staff delegates to resolve the situation. The TSX- and NYSE-listed miner also lamented the timing of the strike action, calling it an “opportunistic course of action amid a global pandemic”. Kinross also reiterated that it has “rigorously complied” with all government mandates related to Covid-19 and said that it “has continued to prioritise the health and wellbeing of its employees while safely operating the mine and maintaining the significant benefits it provides to the Mauritanian economy”. Kinross did not indicate what the rationale behind the strike action was.
