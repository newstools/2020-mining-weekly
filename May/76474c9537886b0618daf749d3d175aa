The project is now estimated to host some 47.5-million tonnes of mineral resource, with Diatreme also announcing a maiden measured mineral resource estimate of some 30.9-million tonnes, grading 99.28% silicon dioxide. “This is a pleasing outcome for Galalar and highlights the potential for the project to become a long-term source of premium quality silica sands, generating valuable new jobs and other economic benefits for the local community, including the traditional owners and project partners Hopevale Congress,” said Diatreme CEO Neil McIntyre. “North Queensland needs new investment and employment opportunities to ensure its post-pandemic recovery and the Galalar project has the potential to deliver exactly that. “The Galalar project is rapidly gaining momentum thanks to the support of local stakeholders and we look forward to progressing it through next step permitting and approvals as quickly as possible to mining activity, amid continued strong demand for high-quality silica sand products from Asian markets.”
