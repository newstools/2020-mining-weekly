PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Lithium/boron developer ioneer has submitted its project plan for its Rhyolite Ridge project, in Nevada, to the US Bureau of Land Management (BLM). The company told shareholders that a submission of the plan was a significant step towards project approval. Once the plan has been reviewed for completeness, and the BLM has registered a Notice of Intent in the Federal Register, it could initiate an environmental impact statement preparation and public engagement process as part of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). “After working closely with the BLM for the last two years, we are pleased to have compiled all the baseline studies and the plan of operations in support of the NEPA process. We look forward to a timely review by the BLM and issuance of the Notice of Intent,” said ioneer MD Bernard Rowe. “Nevada’s economic health is dependent on its robust natural resources. Increased demand for critical minerals to combat global climate change and reduce carbon emissions requires an innovative response to the environmental stewardship of all resources. Ioneer continues to demonstrate its commitment to meeting this responsibility at the Rhyolite Ridge lithium/boron project.” Rowe pointed out that the US and Nevada have prioritized the need for a domestic lithium-ion battery supply chain, and with little current supply, the development of ioneer’s project would be crucial in meeting this goal. A recently completed definitive feasibility study into the Rhyolite Ridge project estimated that it would require a capital investment of $785-million and would produce 20 600 t/y of lithium carbonate, converting in the fourth year of operation to 22 000 t/y of battery grade lithium hydroxide and 174 000 t/y of boric acid, over a mine life of 26 years.
