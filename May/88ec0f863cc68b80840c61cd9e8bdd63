TSX-V-listed African Gold Group says its activities at the Kobada gold project, in Mali, remain unaffected by Covid-19. The company has imposed a strict response plan at the project, which involves reducing the workforce on site and implementing physical distancing for remaining staff. African Gold confirms that a definitive feasibility study on the project will be published before the end of the second quarter. The company plans on doing additional field work at the Faraba and Kobada Extension exploration concessions once restrictions are lifted by the Malian government. African Gold undertook a drilling campaign last year and early this year, to improve understanding of the controls of mineralisation at the Kobada project’s main shear zone. There is potential to expand the project’s resource with targeted drilling.
