PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The federal government has opened public consultation on potential areas for the 2020 offshore petroleum exploration acreage release. Minister for Resources, Water and Northern Australia Keith Pitt said 49 areas have been nominated by the oil and gas industry offshore from Western Australia, Northern Territory, Victoria and the Territory of the Ashmore and Cartier Islands. “We have received numerous and diverse nominations from petroleum exploration and production companies and the seismic industry,” Pitt said. “The continuing release of offshore acreage for petroleum exploration is a crucial way of attracting investment in Australia resources sector and strengthening the economy for the good of all Australians. “Continued resources exploration, be it offshore or onshore, provides for a strong and sustainable resources sector which will lead Australia’s bounce back from the Covid-19 pandemic. “The Coalition government is committed to working with oil and gas companies to ensure continued operations during the national response to the coronavirus.” Consultation provides an opportunity for stakeholders to comment on the nominated areas and to highlight if they may be affected by exploration activities. Responses will inform petroleum explorers of specific issues or concerns which can be taken into account when planning exploration activities. All submissions will be considered before a decision is taken on including nominated areas in the acreage release. Submission can be made until June 29.
