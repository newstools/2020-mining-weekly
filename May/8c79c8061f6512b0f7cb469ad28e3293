PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Vital Metals has been granted government approvals to start mining operations at the North T Zone at its Nechalacho rare earths project, in Canada. Amendments have been made to the land use permit and the water licence issued by the MacKenzie Valley Land and Water Board, enabling the development and operation of a mining and concentrate operation, Vital said on Tuesday. “The receipt of the amended Land Use Permit and Water Licence represents an important step in the development of the Nechalacho rare earths project,” said MD Geoff Atkins. “The amendments will now enable Vital to proceed in the development of what will be the first commercial rare earths project in Canada.” The North T Zone is estimated to host some 105 000 t of resource grading 8.9% rare earth oxides. The project will consist of an opencut surface operation, stockpiles, plant and equipment storage area.
