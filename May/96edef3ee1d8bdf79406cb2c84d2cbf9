The Dwarsrivier chrome mine, in Lydenburg, has suspended all production as a precautionary measure after an employee tested positive for Covid-19, a statement on May 6 confirmed. Operations at the mine will resume once operations management has successfully completed an audit. The affected employee reported for duty on April 29 after the reopening of the mine a week before. The employee was subjected to a screening process as part of the standard return to work protocols. The employee presented signs and symptoms of Covid-19 during the screening process and was referred to the mine’s clinic for further screening. Medical testing took place on the same day, and the results were confirmed as positive on May 3. The employee has been in self-isolation since April 29, and the relevant government departments have been informed of the case and will assist with the management thereof. Dwarsriver confirms that protocols – as set out by the Department of Health and National Institute for Communicable Diseases – will be followed as required. Employees who were known to be in close contact with the affected employee have been removed from site and will remain in self-quarantine until their test results are known. The Dwarsrivier chrome mine is owned by African Rainbow Minerals.
