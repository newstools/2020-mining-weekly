The World Federation of Diamond Bourses (WFDB) has launched its Young Diamantaires website at www.ydts.org. The website has been built by WFDB members for use by the members, and the federation plans on expanding its functionality. WFDB has worked with members of the diamond community globally over the last four years to create a platform through which members can express their views in a safe and constructive manner. Additionally, the platform provides an opportunity to expand a member’s network, participate in events and share with like-minded people ways to improve each other’s businesses. WFDB acting president Yoram Dvash says the diamond industry has over its long history been shaped by many generations of diamantaires. “We are happy to see the younger members of our industry actively engaging in discussions regarding critical issues and exploring how they can build on the rich legacy of this industry,” he adds. The site will not be a trading platform, but a resource centre for young diamantaires worldwide.
