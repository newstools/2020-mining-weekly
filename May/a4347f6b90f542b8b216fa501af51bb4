Global miner Anglo American has announced the retirement of Dr Mphu Ramatlapeng, who stepped down from the board with effect from May 5, following the conclusion of the 2020 Annual General Meeting. She has served as an independent nonexecutive director since July 2013 and brought a broad range of global social welfare and health expertise from across both the public and private sectors. She has also served on the board’s sustainability committee, helping to shape the company’s sustainability agenda, including the development and oversight of its Sustainable Mining Plan. “We are extremely grateful for Mphu’s contribution to Anglo American’s board discussions over many years. Her championing of women in business and the social benefits of capacity building through partnership have provided additional insight to our workforce planning and community support programmes. "We thank her for helping us reinforce Anglo American's sustainability leadership,” said Anglo chairperson Stuart Chambers.
