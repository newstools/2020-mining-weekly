PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Azure Minerals will resume silver and gold exploration in Mexico from June, after the Mexican government tapped the mining and exploration industry as an ‘essential service’ amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Azure on Tuesday said the resumption of activities was conditional upon the Ministry of Health approving each mining company’s new safety measures, and could be subject to further government orders as the pandemic developed. The junior told shareholders that it has designed and implemented strict health, safety and hygiene standards at both its office and in the field, in order to minimise infection risk. The resumption of field exploration work will follow up silver, gold and copper targets identified during the most recent drilling campaign at the Alacran project.
