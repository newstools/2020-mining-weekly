Aim-listed BlueRock Diamonds has advised that its expansion plans for the Kareevlei diamond mine, in the Kimberley region of South Africa, remain on hold. The mine is, however, expected to reach full operating capacity by the end of May. The mine has started ramping up operations, after having restarted following a complete shutdown of mines in South Africa from the end of March to try to curb the spread of Covid-19. The company’s production guidance remains suspended for the 2020/21 financial year.
