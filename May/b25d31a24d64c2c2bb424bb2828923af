PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Explorer Manas Resources will resume its exploration activities in Cote d’Ivoire as the country eases restrictions around the Covid-19 pandemic. The ASX-listed Manas suspended field activities in late March in light of the ongoing pandemic, but on Tuesday said that it had continued to engage with the Ivorian authorities, and will now resume exploration activities while taking precautions to minimise the risk from infection. The gold explorer holds a stake in tenements covering some 1 030 km2 across the Birimian greenstone belt. Auger drilling will now resume at the Mbengue gold project along with geochemical soil sampling at the Eburnea gold project.
