PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Diversified miner Anglo American has started the staged re-entry of its Grosvenor mine, in Queensland, following an explosion last week which injured five workers. CEO of Anglo American’s metallurgical coal business, Tyler Mitchelson over the weekend said that the company would regain access to the longwall area, where the incident occurred, in order to start its expert technical investigation. “We will not recommence mining until we know what happened and how we can prevent it happening again,” Mitchelson said. “As part of our staged re-entry, tomorrow some of our workforce will start work in other areas of the mine complex, where the work is essential for the ongoing safety and integrity of the mine while the investigations proceed. “It would not be right for us or anyone else to comment on the circumstances leading up to this incident, as this will all form part of the thorough expert investigation. It is therefore very premature for anyone to speculate on the causes of this particular incident.”
