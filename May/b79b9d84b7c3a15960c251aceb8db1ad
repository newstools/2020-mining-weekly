Production at the Dwarsrivier chrome mine was suspended this week after an employee tested positive for Covid-19, highlighting the challenge mining firms face as they start operations again as a lockdown eases. The worker was screened last week as part of Dwarsrivier Chrome Mine's return to work protocols and was tested after showing Covid-19 symptoms. Work at the mine, which produced 1.55 million tonnes of chrome ore in the last financial year, was suspended on Monday after the worker's test proved positive a day earlier. The suspension was a precautionary measure and the mine would resume operations once management had successfully completed an audit. The worker had been in self-isolation for a week and other employees who were in close contact with him would remain in self-quarantine until their test results were known.
