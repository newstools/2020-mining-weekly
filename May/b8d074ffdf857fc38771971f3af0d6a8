Aim-listed Oriole Resources is ready to start with a maiden drilling programme at the Bibemi gold project, in Cameroon, as soon as Covid-19-related travel restrictions are lifted later this year. The company has announced that results from an exploration programme done late last year had enabled it to expand its planned 2020 drilling campaign to 1 940 m, or 17 holes, compared with the 14 holes planned initially at the Bakassi zone of the project. Some of the results from initial exploration include 35.8 g/t gold at surface. One hole that the company plans to test returned a historic intersection of 38 m grading 2.21 g/t gold. Oriole says it wants to further expand the planned drill programme to 3 000 m, following further detailed mapping of the northern Bakassi zone. CEO Tim Livesey says results to date have defined significant gold mineralisation over a strike of more than 5 km at Bakassi and the company already has a good understanding of the mineralising systems in two dimensions. “With at least a 2 000 m drilling programme in sight, we are looking forward to testing the system in the third dimension during the second half of the year and restarting our fieldwork in Cameroon as soon as the current global situation allows.”
