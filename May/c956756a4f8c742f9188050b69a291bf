PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Diversified major Rio Tinto has introduced Covid-19 testing at its Diavik diamond mine, in the Northwest Territories, in Canada, as an additional precautionary measure to protect employees and community members. The miner said over the weekend that not-for-profit public health experts GuardRX have installed an on-site laboratory at Diavik to conduct a testing programme for employees and contractors using nasopharyngeal swabs. The programme is being implemented in collaboration with the Chief Public Health Officer of the Northwest Territories, with all personnel tested on arrival at Diavik and before leaving to return home. “We are committed to doing everything we can to protect our people and communities, and this testing will add a further layer to the robust precautionary measures we already have in place at Diavik,” said Diavik COO Richard Storrie. “We will continue to be guided by the Northwest Territories government, to ensure that we operate safely and maintain the significant contribution we make to communities in the region.” The on-site testing will add a further layer to the precautionary controls for workers at Diavik that already include a 14-day self-monitoring period before travelling to the mine, medical screening through a hotline with physician assistants before travelling to the mine, heath screening with temperature checks before boarding flights, and daily monitoring.
