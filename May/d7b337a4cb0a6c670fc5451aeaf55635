TSX-listed Ivanhoe Mines has postponed its annual general meeting (AGM) and the date for sending out the companyâ€™s executive compensation disclosure to no later than end-September. This follows restrictions on public gatherings enacted by the Canadian government, in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, the company has implemented protective measures at its Kamoa-Kakula project sites in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). This includes strict delivery protocols, only for food and critical equipment supply. The company appointed a task team to undertake Covid-19 response planning, led by Dr Nicolette du Plessis, a professor from University of Pretoria in South Africa and a specialist in paediatric infectious diseases. Further, the Platreef shaft project, in South Africa, started operating with lower staff levels and the Kipushi mine development, in the DRC, has been temporarily suspended.
