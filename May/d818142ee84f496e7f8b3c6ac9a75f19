TSX-V-listed Integra Resources has resumed drilling at the DeLamar project, in Idaho. The company has put enhanced operational procedures in place to protect the health of staff and contractors. The project was on a four-week drill break, in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, while Integra prepared an accelerated drilling ramp-up plan during this month, which will focus on high-grade gold and silver targets at the Florida Mountain deposit. A second drill rig is due to arrive at Florida Mountain in June, which will help to add to the project’s mineral resource during 2020. The resumed exploration activity involves between 5 000 m and 7 000 m of diamond drilling, in about 20 holes. Primary drill targets at Florida Mountain include lateral and down-dip extensions of high-grade shoots intercepted from drilling done in 2019. The company previously intercepted mineralisation grading 19.58 g/t gold and 68.18 g/t over 2.13 m. Meanwhile, the company also plans to start up a 5 000 m reverse circulation drill rig on the War Eagle deposit, in July.
