Not-for-profit organisation (NPO) Young Mining Professionals (YMP) Toronto’s “Mining Cares” initiative has raised $190 420 for the United Way Greater Toronto (UWGT) Covid-19 Emergency Relief Fund. Donors of YMP raised $95 210, with YMP matching the first $5 000 of donations. All of these funds were matched by Polar Asset Management and other leaders in the asset management sector resulting in the overall total. All donations will be invested in the community to help those most affected by Covid-19. YMP’s initiative is aimed at engaging the mining industry at large, including its corporate partners and young people, in a coordinated effort aimed at providing much needed assistance to those who are most vulnerable to the effects of Covid-19. YMP Toronto is an NPO of mining professionals that share the goal of advancing the global profile and leadership of the mining and exploration industry. In 2018 YMP Toronto established the YMP Scholarship Fund, a registered Canadian charity that has raised over $300 000. The YMP Scholarship Fund's mandate is to donate 100% of donor receipts to scholarship recipients.
