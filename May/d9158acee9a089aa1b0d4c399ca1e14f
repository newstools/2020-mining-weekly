PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The government of Gabon has approved a Mining Convention Agreement over the Kroussou zinc/lead project, allowing ASX-listed Apollo Minerals to earn-in a majority interest in the project. Apollo in 2019 reached an agreement with Trek Metals to acquire up to an 80% interest in the project area through a two-phased earn-in valued at a combined A$4-million. Apollo director Robert Behets on Monday said that the company was pleased with the approval of the Mining Convention Agreement, adding that the Gabonese government had demonstrated support for the project. “This approval provides Apollo Minerals with confidence and certainty as the company looks to commence its initial drilling campaign at the project in the coming months. With only four of the 18 currently identified prospects having been drill tested to date, we are excited about the multiple opportunities for potential discovery of further shallow, base metal mineralisation within the project area.”
