PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The New South Wales’ Resources Regulator has given ASX-listed Alkane Resources approval to develop an exploration drive from its existing Wyoming One underground operation, at its Tomingley gold project, in New South Wales, to the Roswell and San Antonio deposits, some 4 km south of the mine. The approval was an important milestone towards a future potential underground mine at Roswell and San Antonio, and could be developed independently of an opencut operation, the miner said. The exploration drive will be sized to accommodate future production. MD Nic Earner said on Monday that the company had equipment purchased, personnel recruited and land acquired to allow the development to proceed, and would now incorporate the timing of the drive development into the Tomingley gold operation’s budget schedules, as well as its regional exploration plans. “Given the prospectivity of the region around our existing operations, this approval provides Alkane with all the exploration and, in time, production options to extend the life-of-mine at Tomingley well into the future.” Roswell is estimated to host some 445 000 oz of gold while San Antonio is estimated to host 453 000 oz. Alkane is preparing conceptual mine plans for the deposits, which can be used to progress government mining approvals.
