Aim-listed Sunrise Resources has published its environment assessment and supplemental environmental reports for the CS pozzolan-perlite project for public comment. The project is based in Nevada, US. Public commentary will close 30 calendar days from May 15. The company says the public release of these documents represents the culmination of more than two years’ worth of solid work towards a mine plan and reclamation permit application. "We are delighted to have reached this final stage in the permitting process, and while there have been a number of delays to the process, the end result is a robust environmental assessment,” says Sunrise chairperson Patrick Cheetham. The company believes a highlight of the environmental assessment is the contribution of our project to a reduction in carbon emissions. “This comes from the replacement of Portland cement with CS natural pozzolan, which, at the maximum planned production rate of 500 000 t/y, gives an annual carbon dioxide reduction equivalent to the average annual emissions from more than 10 400 US households,” Cheetham explains. He adds that Sunrise will move to initiate first production of perlite and natural pozzolan for larger scale customer trials as soon as possible after it receives a positive permitting decision. The mine plan envisions a 27-year mine life, where both perlite and natural pozzolan will be mined from the main zone in three phases, over the first 15 years. Thereafter, pozzolan will continue to be mined from the Tyff zone in a fourth phase. The company intends to mine about 1.6-million tons of perlite and 14.5-million tons of pozzolan a year for the first 15 years.
