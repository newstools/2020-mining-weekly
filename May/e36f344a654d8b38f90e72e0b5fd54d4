PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The Western Australian government on Friday announced that royalty rates for construction and industrial minerals used by Western Australia's building and construction sector will remain fixed for the next five-years starting in July. Mines and Petroleum Minister Bill Johnston said that the state government’s actions provide further support to companies during the Covid‑19 pandemic. "The decision not to increase the specific rate royalty follows the government's A$24.5-million package to help the building and construction industry maintain a skilled workforce and support apprentices and trainees,” said Johnston.  "Producers of basic raw materials play an important role in Western Australia's growth as they allow new homes to be built and new roads and railways to be constructed.  "Leaving the rate royalty at current levels reflects our commitment to helping our economy recover post-Covid-19." The unchanged rate royalties are 73c for aggregate, clays, dolomite, gravel, gypsum, construction use limestone, rock, (common) salt and sand, and 117c for building stone, chemical use limestone, metallurgical use silica and talc.
