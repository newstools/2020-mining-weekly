PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Mining major Anglo American on Thursday said that the cause of the explosion which rocked its Grosvenor mine, in Queensland, on Wednesday, injuring five, has not yet been established. “Our focus right now is on supporting our injured colleagues and their families, and our team is doing everything they can to provide support,” said Anglo American’s CEO of its metallurgical coal business, Tyler Mitchelson. “We are all devastated and we don’t yet understand what caused this incident. Once it is safe to return underground, we will commence an expert technical investigation to ensure we understand what has happened. “We will then work with our regulators and other stakeholders to ensure this type of incident never happens again.” Operations at the mine remain suspended as the miner worked with the relevant authorities to ensure the mine was safe to return underground.
