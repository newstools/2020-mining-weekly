TSX- and Aim-listed Condor Gold has been granted an environmental permit for the development and exploitation of gold from the high-grade America openpit, in Nicaragua. The company’s America openpit hosts 114 000 t at a grade of 8.1 g/t gold, for 30 000 oz of gold in the indicated mineral resource category. In the inferred mineral resource category, the pit hosts 677 000 t at a grade of 3.1 g/t gold, for 67 000 oz. Condor says the America openput compliments the already permitted La India openpit, and the recently permitted high grade Metiza openpit, both in Nicaragua. Overall, the company is permitted to produce from three openpits for a total 1.12-million ounces of gold. Condor continues doing mining dilution studies and pit optimisation studies, which will be incorporated in a mine production schedule. Ahead of production, Condor will complete infill drilling on the Mestiza and America openpits to convert the majority of mineralised material to the indicated mineral resource category.
