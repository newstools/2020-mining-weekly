Dual-listed Altus Strategies has recorded encouraging results from a 70-hole 2 042 m shallow air core (AC) drilling programme to test the potential strike extension of the FT Prospect at the company's Tabakorole gold project, in southern Mali. The programme was completed under a joint venture with Glomin Services. AC intercepts in highly weathered material include (not true width of intervals) 1.05 g/t gold over 12 m from 9 m; 0.77 g/t gold over 21 m from surface; and 0.95 g/t gold over 15 m from surface. The company says there is excellent correlation between magnetic anomalies and drilled mineralisation. The FT Prospect is open along strike with further anomalies yet to be systematically tested. "We are very encouraged by the gold intersections from this shallow AC drilling programme at the FT Prospect. "Perhaps most significantly, the results confirm a very high degree of correlation between gold mineralisation and the structures as interpreted from the recent ground magnetic survey. This programme has extended the potential strike of the 2.7-km-long FT Prospect and indicates that further extensions seem probable,” says Altus CE Steven Poulton. He notes that the next phase of work is likely to be an initial diamond drilling programme.
