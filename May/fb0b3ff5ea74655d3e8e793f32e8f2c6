Aim-listed Sylvania Platinum is in the process of ramping up and maximising production at its six tailings retreatment facilities, under strict conditions stipulated by the South African government. The government started easing Covid-19 restrictions from May 1, after Sylvania had to scale down its operations to only care-and-maintenance activities for five weeks during a national Level 5 lockdown, during which only essential services were allowed to operate. The company confirms that all six operations are running, albeit at reduced but stable throughput, with platinum group metals concentrate starting to be dispatched again. Sylvania has implemented the necessary training, health, hygiene, safety and personal protective procedures on site to keep employees as safe as possible from contracting the virus. The company’s mine tailings retreatment sites are based in South Africa’s Bushveld Igneous Complex.
