PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Northern Territory Minister for Mining and Industry Nicole Manison has approved major Glencore’s amended mining management plan for the McArthur River zinc mine, allowing mining activities to continue. “The Territory government is supporting jobs and protecting the environment through strict regulation for the McArthur River mine and its future operations,” said Manison, noting that the project employs some 1 000 employees and contractors. “Our resources industry is one of the biggest contributors to the Northern Territory economy, and our strong future in mining will play a huge role in making the Territory the comeback capital of Australia. “The approval of the amended mining management plan 2020 ensures McArthur River mine can continue to operate in an environmentally safe and responsible manner, while continuing to support thousands of territory jobs.” The McArthur River mine has been operating since 1995 and is one of the world’s largest zinc resources. The mining management plan 2020 outlines the mine’s sustainable ongoing resource development in the territory in a way which minimises environmental impacts and ensures long-term beneficial land uses after closure.
