China's Nanjing Hanrui Cobalt expects to start its cobalt production line in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in late-November to December, GM Liang Jie said on Wednesday. The 5 000 t/y production line in Kolwezi, DRC, which was expected to go online earlier in the year, was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic, Liang said on the sidelines of the China International Nickel and Cobalt Conference in Nanjing. The firm was still discussing sales contracts with foreign traders and domestic users, Liang said. He did not say when the project would reach full production but said "the sooner the better."
