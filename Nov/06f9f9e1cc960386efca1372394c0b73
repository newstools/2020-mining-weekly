Aim-listed Katoro Gold has completed all the technical work related to the upgrade and restatement of the Blyvoor gold tailings project resource statement, with specific reference to the resource and geotechnical drill programme. About 1 500 samples were produced from the now completed resource drill programme and submitted for assay analysis. These assay results have now all been received back from the laboratory. The assay results, in conjunction with the confirmatory metallurgical test results and geotechnical results, are now being interpreted and integrated into the various key technical reports. The final reports, with an updated resource and reserve statement and South African Code for the Reporting of Mineral Asset Valuation, or SAMVAL Code, valuation report, are expected to be received by the company during November. "I am pleased to announce the positive operational progress at Blyvoor where we remain on course regarding the key project objectives as we target early gold production generating considerable revenues for Katoro and our partners. "Blyvoor is a substantial opportunity for Katoro and with each step in our work completed our excitement rises, particularly as we now approach completion of the technical work,” says Katoro chairperson Louis Coetzee.
