PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Junior Bryah Resources has been granted a mining lease over its Tumblegum South gold prospect, at its Gabanintha project in Western Australia. “This is a significant milestone on the pathway to near-term gold production at Tumblegum South. We have been successful in progressing the mining lease application and to have it granted in less than eight months is a credit to all involved and gives us a great chance to capitalise on the robust gold price,” said Bryah MD Neil Marston. “We are well advanced in negotiations with a gold processing plant owner about collaborating on the development of the resource with our joint goal being to be fully permitted to start mining and processing gold sometime in 2021.” Marston said that the resource needed additional infill drilling to bring it to a measured category, which would start later this month, ahead of a programme of metallurgical testwork and pit design studies early next year.
