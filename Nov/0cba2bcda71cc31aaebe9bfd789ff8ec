Diamond miner De Beers Group’s Voorspoed mine, in the Free State, has handed over a R5-million old age facility in partnership with the Ngwathe local municipality to the Ratang Maqheku Centre for the Aged in Parys. The project forms part of the Voorspoed mine’s social and labour plan (SLP), specifically its Community Development Programme, which aims to uplift communities of the Free State province and develop working partnerships to enhance and influence economic and social factors. Through its Building Forever strategy, De Beers Group is helping communities gain access to opportunities and thrive, with the aim of leaving a positive and lasting legacy for mining communities to enjoy sustainable livelihoods beyond the life of its operations. Ratang Maqheku Centre previously operated from three rented backyard rooms in Tumahole, Parys. The centre caters for 30 elderly people, and provides food, primary healthcare services and exercise, as well as access to the local library to improve their literacy and writing skills. The new 470 m2 facility, which was built by a local black female-owned company Tshepo ya Rona, comprises two bedrooms, a sick bay, workshop area, rest area, consultation room, three offices, dining area, kitchen with a pantry and laundry room, two ablution facilities, as well as a reception and waiting area. Ratang Maqheku Centre also received a brand new 22-seater vehicle to transport the elderly to and from the centre.
