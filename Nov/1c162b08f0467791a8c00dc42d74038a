PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Federal Energy and Emissions Reduction Minister Angus Taylor this week said that the government would only consider intervening in the domestic gas market if it was left with no other option. Taylor said at a Ministerial Gas Roundtable on Thursday that gas had a significant role to play in Australia’s manufacturing sector, and supporting the Australians who work in the sector. “This meeting is all about kick-starting the discussion between producers and users to make sure we're getting this right. “Creating a Code between suppliers and users led by the industry can work for both sides and we are working in a way that continues to grow this industry and to deliver an outcome for Australian users as well as overseas users. “Engagement is going to be crucial to get this to work. Part of the engagement needs to be led by us, but really the most important leadership will come from all of you. And this is something I can’t emphasise enough,” Taylor said. “Our approach as a government when it comes to issues like these is we will only step in if we have to. We prefer not to, we much prefer industry to lead. “But we have shown in a number of areas if we can't get the outcome we need, we will step in . . . we must get the industry to the solution with facilitation as needed by the government, but it is crucially important that we see leadership from everyone who is on this call,” he told members of the Roundtable. The federal government earlier this year announced that it was considering a prospective national gas reservation scheme as part of its plan to make energy affordable for families and businesses and supporting jobs as part of Australia’s recovery from the Covid-19 recession. A gas reservation issues paper was released for public consultation and the government is seeking information and feedback.
