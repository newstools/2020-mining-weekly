Aim- and BSE-listed diamond explorer Botswana Diamonds' exploration programme has identified several kimberlite targets at its Marsfontien and Thorny River projects in South Africa. To build on the exploration programme, the company plans to start drilling, through a multihole programme, at the sites within two weeks. Botswana Diamonds reports that its exploration programme comprised a number of geophysical techniques, including gravity, electromagnetics, magnetics and ground-penetrating radar. Out of ten areas surveyed, the findings have identified four target areas, including a potential blow of up to 0.25 ha, as well as swells in the kimberlite dyke system of up to 10 m. Chairperson John Teeling says the Thorny River and Marsfontein exploration is designed to identify potential blows and kimberlite veins. “We have identified four likely targets – one blow and three swells. These will be drilled in the coming weeks. Some of the kimberlite pipes in this area contain very high diamond grades.”
