Lithium technology group Livent has withdrawn from a joint development agreement with emerging lithium developer E3 Metals, citing resource and capital allocation considerations. Although opting out, Livent has expressed confidence in E3â€™s technology and the Leduc aquifer, the junior says. The company states that it plans to commercialise the developments completed through the partnership with Livent. Further, despite opting out of the existing agreement, Livent has expressed interest to E3 in working together to further advance the direct lithium extraction (DLE) technology under a different deal structure. The Calgary testing facility will be opened in early 2021 and work will continue towards construction and operation of the field pilot plant to fully demonstrate the capabilities and effectiveness of the DLE technology.
