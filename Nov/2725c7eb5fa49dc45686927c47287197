PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Dual listed gold miner OceanaGold has set itself a target of net zero emissions by 2025. “OceanaGold has been strongly committed to responsible mining for 30 years, and with current emissions lower than global industry average, we are already on the journey to reduce our carbon footprint,” president and CEO Michael Holmes said. “OceanaGold fully supports the Paris Agreement’s goal of limiting the increase in global average temperature to well below 2 oC above pre-industrial levels. In line with this objective, we are setting a goal to achieve net zero emissions from our operations by 2050, and we will establish milestone intensity targets by 2022 to support this goal.” Holmes said on Thursday that the delivery of net zero carbon emissions production would rely on step changes from new and emerging technologies to decarbonize the miner’s electricity supplies and mobile equipment use, and incrementally improve energy use, efficiency and reducing energy consumption. Since 2018, the ASX- and TSX-listed gold miner has been implementing a company-wide programme of automation, digital and process transformation, which Holmes said is helping to define the company’s journey to operate the mines of the future. “Digital transformation presents an industry-wide opportunity to enhance performance and reduce impact. Successful implementation of the rapid advances in technology, innovation, automation, digitization and electrification are central to achieving OceanaGold’s commitment to reduce our environmental impact,” Holmes added.
