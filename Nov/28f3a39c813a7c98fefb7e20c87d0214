Midtier precious metals miner Endeavour Silver has expanded the footprint of its Terronera project, in Jalisco state, Mexico, to 20 128 ha through the acquisition of two adjacent groups of mineral concessions, La Sanguijuela and Cerro Gordo. “These two acquisitions not only expand our property footprint at Terronera, they add multiple new mineralised vein structures with strong resource potential where we can add value through the drill bit,” CEO Bradford Cooke said on Wednesday. At La Sanguijuela, Endeavour acquired an option to purchase the 2 759 concession for $550 000, payable over four years. La Sanguijuela lies adjacent to the northern boundary of the Terronera concessions about 10 km northwest of the historic mine adit on the Terronera vein and covers the possible northwest extension of the Terronera vein and the possible west extension of the Los Reyes vein. Endeavour acquired Cerro Gordo by staking the 2 200 ha concessions, located 10 km south of the historic mine adit on the Terronera vein. These concessions cover the possible southeast extensions of four Terronera footwall veins, Pena Gorda-Canoas, Los Venados-La Carbonera, Pena Blanca-El Alacran and El Mirador-Los Tablones, as well as three other veins, El Maguey-El Madrono, Monte Obscuro-Musgos and La Muda-Monte Grande.
