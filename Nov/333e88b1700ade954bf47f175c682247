Mineral exploration company Tyranna Resources is open to alternative offers for the Jumbuck gold project, in Western Australia, after shareholders rejected the sale of the project to Syngas. Syngas offered A$2.25-million for the asset, which has also attracted interest from other parties, including Marmota. Marmota on November 17 increased its offer price for Jumbuck to A$3-million. The Jumbuck project hosts 319 000 oz of gold.
