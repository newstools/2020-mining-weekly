PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Gold miner Resolute Mining is continuing its strategic review of the Bibiani gold mine, in Ghana. Acting CEO Stuart Gale told delegates at Africa Downunder Conference, in Perth, that the company had launched the review in January to consider the benefits of continuing operations at Bibiani, or to consider if another company would be better placed to continue with Bibiani. “We continue with that process, but while we might have liked to get people to site, Covid-19 has precluded us to get folks in. But Ghana has lifted its hard borders and we have had the opportunity to get some people on site to have a look at Bibiani,” Gale said. The project was acquired by Resolute in 2004, and was placed on care and maintenance shortly after, to allow exploration activities to enable the development of an economically viable, long-term, large scale operation. A 2018 feasibility study into a Bibiani restart estimated that the project could produce some 100 000 oz/y over a ten-year mine life, at a total capital cost of around $115-million. The project is currently estimated to host some 21.7-million tonnes, grading 3.6 g/t gold for 2.5-million ounces of contained gold.
