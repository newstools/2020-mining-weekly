Canadian base metals miner Lundin Mining on Thursday announced that the Candelaria Supervisors and LMC Supervisors Unions, together representing about 230 associates, had ratified new 32-month collective agreements. The agreements were reached during the legislated negotiation process. Lundin reported that the resumption of partial operations at the Chile mine was under way following ratification of the new collective agreement with the Candelaria AOS Union, representing 550 workers, on November 20. As part of the collective bargaining cycle, agreements have been reached this year with four of the five unions representing employees at the Candelaria Copper Mining Complex. The Candelaria Mine Workers Union, representing approximately 350 workers, continues with its labour action. The Candelaria copper mine announced plans to suspend operations at the mine on October 20, after the unions called on their workers to begin strikes.
