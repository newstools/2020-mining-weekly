Toronto-listed gold developer Treasury Metals has appointed Jeremy Wyeth as president and CEO with effect from December 7, replacing Greg Ferron who will be transitioning to a consulting role effective immediately. Wyeth started his career with diamond miner De Beers, and worked on mines around the world in Canada, Russia, Brazil and South Africa. With De Beers, he moved to Canada to lead the development, construction, commissioning and ramp-up of the Victor diamond mine. The Victor project had a capital budget of $1-billion and Treasury says, under Wyeth's leadership, it was completed nine months ahead of schedule and under budget. "Jeremy's depth and breadth of experience, and his track record of mine-building on time and on budget, make him the ideal candidate to lead Treasury through its next phase of growth as we advance the Goldlund and Goliath projects in north-western Ontario. Not only is he an experienced mine builder, but he is also a successful team builder with an entrepreneurial spirit,‚Äù says Treasury chairperson Bill Fisher. Ferron announced his intention to step down earlier this year and will continue to act as an adviser to the company to help ensure a smooth transition for the incoming CEO.
