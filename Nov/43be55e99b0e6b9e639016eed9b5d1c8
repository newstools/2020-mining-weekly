Operations at the Topia precious metals mine, in Mexico, have been suspended, owing to the detection of Covid-19 among the workforce. The suspension would not exceed 30 days and would not impact on the group’s consolidated production guidance of 146 000 gold-equivalent ounces (GEOs) to 158 000 GEOs for the year, dual-listed Great Panther reported on Monday. For the three months ended September 30, Topia produced an average of 1 400 GEOs a month and accounted for about 9% of the company's revenues. Great Panther noted that its Tucano mine, in Brazil, and GMC mine, in Mexico, remained in operation with strict Covid-19 protocols in place. A reduced Topia workforce would remain on site to maintain essential activities for the duration of the voluntary suspension.
