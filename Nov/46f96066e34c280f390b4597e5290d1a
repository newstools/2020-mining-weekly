PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Junior Artemis Resources has raised a further A$2.3-million through the sale of additional noncore assets. "As flagged in our recent quarterly report, I am pleased to advise shareholders that asset disposals to yield approximately A$2.3-million are either in treasury or in the process of closing over the coming days,” said Artemis executive director Alastair Clayton. “This nondilutive funding will only further strengthen our financial capacity as we continue with our aggressive exploration activities across our Pilbara gold/copper portfolio. With the first drill results due very soon from Carlow Castle drilling, we expect a very busy reporting period from both of our active projects leading into the Christmas period and beyond.” The junior in September raised A$5.78-million through the sale of its 1.64-million shares in TSX-V-listed Novo Resource, and total cash from its noncore asset disposal programme since March this year has now reached more than A$9-million.
