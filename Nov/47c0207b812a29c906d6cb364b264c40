London-listed Red Rock Resources has mobilised a team to its 80%-owned Luanshimba licence, in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), to start a geophysics programme. The programme serves as a follow-up to strong copper and cobalt anomalism identified during a prior termite mound sampling programme late in 2018. The geophysics programme will be supervised by Minerals Exploration Associates and will consist of a ground magnetics survey and an induced polarisation survey. The company will send raw data to Ronacher McKenzie Geoscience for interpretation. The programme will help to identify conductive targets at the site and enable drill targeting. "The strong anomalies obtained from initial exploration in this favourable geological setting, with copper values in the regolith samples ranging up to 519 ppm and cobalt values up to 425 ppm, are likely very significant in this part of the copperbelt and suggest the presence of copper and cobalt mineralisation at depth. “Once we start pitting and drilling, we are likely to have to maintain a continuous presence on site to keep artisanal activity under control, so good preparatory work, including geophysics, which will enable us to refine targeting and develop a cost-effective programme for subsoil exploration, was a critical next step and is now under way,” says chairperson Andrew Bell.
