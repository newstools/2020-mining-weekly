PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Copper miner Sandfire Resources has exercised its 32.15-million options in fellow-listed Auris Minerals, priced at 8c each. The options were issued to Sandfire as part of the up-front consideration in relation to the acquisition of an 80% interest in the Sams Creek gold project, in New Zealand, at the end of September this year. Under the terms of that agreement, Auris acquired Sandfire’s wholly owned subsidiary Sams Creek Gold for an up-front consideration of 102.5-million new fully paid ordinary shares, priced at 8c each, for a total consideration of A$8.2-million. Auris on Friday reported that with Sandfire’s exercise of its options, the company had now raised A$2.57-million, with Sandfire holding a 7.29% interest in the company. Subject to the completion of the Sams Creek gold project, Sandfire will hold a 19.99% interest in Aurus. “We are very pleased to welcome Sandfire on to the company’s register as a substantial shareholder. Following the recent completion of due diligence on the proposed acquisition of an 80% interest in the Sams Creek gold project and the existing ongoing relationship with Sandfire in joint venture on various tenements held in the Bryah basin, we look forward to further strengthening the partnership and working towards a rewarding outcome for all shareholders,” said Auris chairperson Neville Bassett.
