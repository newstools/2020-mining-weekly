Base metals miner Hudbay Minerals has resumed full production at its 777 mine, in Flon Flon, Manitoba, following a skip hoist incident in October. The shaft repair activities were completed ahead of schedule and the total direct repair cost was under the estimated C$5-million, the company said on Wednesday. Although fourth-quarter production and sales volumes would be impacted, Hudbay said it continued to expect the Manitoba business unit to achieve its full year production and unit cost guidance for 2020. “The shaft incident was an unfortunate event, but the team responded quickly and was successful in bringing this important asset back into full production ahead of schedule,” said president and CEO Peter Kukielski. The 777 mine – Hudbay’s former flagship mine – is approaching the end of its mine life after 15 years. Final production is anticipated in 2022.
