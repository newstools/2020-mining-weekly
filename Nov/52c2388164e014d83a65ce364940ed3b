Toronto-listed gold miner Endeavour Mining on Tuesday confirmed that it was in discussions with fellow-listed Teranga Mining regarding a potential merger. The transaction under consideration was a merger-of-equals-style combination, the company said, responding to press coverage regarding a potential tie-up. Both companies operate gold mines in Cote dâ€™Ivoire and Burkina Faso. Earlier this year, Endeavour bought Semafo for about C$1-billion, which made it the largest gold producer in West Africa.
