Developer BCI Minerals has entered into an access agreement with the lease holder of the Mardie station, which overlaps in small areas with the proposed Mardie project development footprint and tenure. The access agreement provides Pastoral Management’s (PMPL’s) consent to the grant of key Mining Act tenure required to construct and operate the Mardie project, and consent to the taking of land required for the Cape Preston West Port and the dedication of its associated access road. The access agreement will also allow BCI to undertake certain early works activities on access roads and preliminary infrastructure. “This is an important step for the Mardie project in that one of the three key access matters has now been resolved. Discussions with the Pilbara Ports Authority on the port lands tenure are progressing well, and BCI continues to work collaboratively with the owners of gas pipelines in the south of the Mardie project,” said BCI MD Alwyn Vorster. A definitive feasibility study has confirmed that the project could become a globally significant tier 1 project.

At Mardie, an inexhaustible seawater resource will be concentrated through solar and wind evaporation to sustainably produce 4.4-million tonnes a year of high-purity sodium chloride salt and 120 000 t/y of sulphate of potash (SoP) to supply the growing chemical and agricultural industries in Asia over an operating life of at least 60 years.

The project includes nine evaporation ponds, 34 crystallisers and 18 SoP crystallisers, a salt plant and an SoP plant. The development schedule is targeting a final investment decision in the first quarter of 2021, with construction expected to start in the second quarter of 2021.

First salt sales are expected by mid-2024, and first SoP sales by mid-2025.
