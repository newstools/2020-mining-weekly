Aim-listed Keras Resources says constructive meetings have been held with officials from the Togo government regarding permitting of the Nayéga manganese mine. The mine is wholly owned by the company’s 85%-owned subsidiary, Société Générale de Mines (SGM). Keras CEO Russell Lamming has recently returned from Lomé, Togo, where he had meetings with key government officials. These included Mila Aziablé, the Minister of Mines and Energy, and Kayi Mivedor, the Minister of the newly formed Ministry of Investment Promotion, which is focused on encouraging and enhancing investment in Togo. Follow-up meetings were also held with the State-owned Togo Invest Corporation, which is helping to assist the permitting process at Nayéga. “Constructive meetings were undertaken with both the ministries of Mines and Energy and Investment Promotion during my recent trip to Togo; I expect to get feedback in the near term on what the pathway to final permitting at Nayéga comprises. “I am particularly encouraged with Togo Invest’s endorsement of Keras’ investment in the country, which marks the start of a constructive collaboration, in tandem with the creation of a Ministry of Investment Promotion by the new Togo government; both are positive steps for the Nayéga mine and Keras’ further investment,” Lamming says.
