London-listed Hochschild Mining on Monday announced that it had halted operations at its San Jose mine, in Argentina, to comply with a regional lockdown in Santa Cruz. The province has witnessed a significant increase in Covid-19 infections, the mining company reported. Hochschild said it expected to restart limited operations on December 4. The stoppage would affect the company's revised full-year guidance of between 280Â 000 and 290 000 gold-equivalent ounces, or 24-million to 25-million silver-equivalent ounces.
