JOHANNESBURG – Zambia produced 646 111 t of copper between January and September 2020, up from 590 321 t in the same period last year, Mines Minister Richard Musukwa said on Thursday, attributing the 9.45% rise to increased mine output. Africa's no.2 copper producer, Zambia defaulted last Friday after failing to pay the $42.5-million coupon on its Eurobond debt.
