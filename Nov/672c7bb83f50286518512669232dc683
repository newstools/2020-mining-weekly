PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Australia’s quarterly National Greenhouse Gas Inventory update has confirmed that the country has beaten its 2020 target by 459-million tonnes. Australia’s overachievement on its 2020 target is due in large part to significant structural declines in emissions from the electricity and agriculture sectors, said federal Energy and Emissions Reduction Minister Angus Taylor. In 2019/20, emissions in the National Electricity Market dropped 5.3%, to a new record low. Australia has invested A$30-billion in renewable energy since 2017 and continues to deploy new solar and wind ten times faster than the global average. Taylor noted that recent advice from the Clean Energy Regulator is that this trend is expected to continue in coming years. “Emissions from cropping and grazing have fallen by 69% over the last three decades, from around 300-million tonnes per year in 1990 to around 92-million tonnes today. Changes in land management practices over the last decade have contributed to Australia’s forest cover increasing faster than any other OECD country over that period, according to the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization,” the Minister added. In the year to June 2020, emissions were 513.4-million tonnes, 3%, or 16-million tonnes, lower than in 2018/19. This is the lowest level since 1998. Emissions are now 25% lower than forecast when the Coalition came into government in 2013. “Australia’s emissions are 16.6% below the level of emissions in 2005. While the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdowns have had an impact on the transport sector, reducing liquid fuel consumption by 17% in the June quarter 2019, this has been partially offset by the resilience of Australia’s export and industrial sectors. Of Australia’s total emissions, 39.3% are generated by the production of exports for overseas markets. The value of Australia’s overseas exports has increased by $80-billion since September 2013, reflecting the government’s good economic management,” Taylor said. He noted that despite upward pressure from exports and industry, emissions per capita and the emissions intensity of the economy continue to fall and are at their lowest levels in three decades. In 2019/20, emissions per capita were 44.7% below 1990 levels, while the emissions intensity of the economy was 64.7% below 1990 levels.
