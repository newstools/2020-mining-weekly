Dual-listed Alexco Resources has commissioned the Keno Hill mill, in Yukon, marking a significant milestone on its journey towards establishing the company as Canada’s only primary silver producer. The Keno Hill district mill resumed production, with lead/silver and zinc concentrates The initial ore source for mill commissioning is the Bellekeno underground mine where drilling, blasting and extraction of ore from long hole stopes continues. “This achievement has only been possible with the hard work and determination of all our employees and contractors who have worked safely to deliver this milestone. Congratulations to all. There is still a lot of work ahead in our ramp-up and underground development programmes at the Bermingham and Flame and Moth operations, which are scheduled to sequentially replace Bellekeno ore feed over the course of the first half of 2021,” says Alexco chairperson and CEO Clynt Nauman. Total personnel employed at Keno Hill now include about 150 employees and contractors with over 93% residing in either Yukon or British Columbia. In the near term, underground development activities are continuing at both the Flame and Moth and Bermingham mines with focus on advancements of the primary ramps and haulage ways, establishing vent level access and installing remaining underground infrastructure. Contract raise crews are scheduled to mobilise in early December to begin installation of the Bermingham surface raise. The majority of surface infrastructure and mill projects are nearing completion, including the recent commissioning of the Bermingham water treatment plant.
