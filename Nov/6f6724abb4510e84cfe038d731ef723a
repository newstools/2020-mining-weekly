The compensatory mitigation plan (CMP) for the Pebble copper/gold/ molybdenum project, in Bristol Bay, Alaska, has been submitted to the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Toronto-listed Northern Dynasty Minerals reported on Monday. The company did not release any details about the CMP, which had to be developed to show how it intended to mitigate the proposed mine’s environmental impacts within the Bristol Bay watershed. The USACE concluded in August that it could not permit the Pebble project as proposed, owing to the treat of environmental damage. It gave Northern Dynasty 90 days to develop a plan to mitigate those impacts. Northern Dynasty pointed out that it had completed the CMP ahead of the 90-day deadline, which is set to expire on November 18. “The ‘in-kind’ and ‘in-watershed’ requirement for mitigation the USACE established for Pebble clearly sets a high bar for offsetting project effects on wetlands and other aquatic features, but it’s a challenge we have embraced and believe we can achieve,” said Northern Dynasty president and CEO Ron Thiessen. “Based on the findings of the final EIS [environmental impact assessment], we already know Pebble can operate safely and reliably, while fully protecting the water, fish and wildlife resources of Bristol Bay. Meeting the USACE’s challenging mitigation requirements provides even greater evidence that Pebble can and will co-exist with commercial, subsistence and sport fisheries in southwest Alaska.” An approved CMP is a prerequisite to receiving a federal record of decision.
