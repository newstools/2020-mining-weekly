Diversified miner Nordgold has equipped its new West Africa Training Centre, at the Lefa mine, in Guinea, with a Cybermine Full-Mission Simulator. The simulator is a training tool for mining fleet operators that is designed to improve their skills through safe and efficient manipulation of modern mining equipment. Nordgold launched the West Africa Training Centre earlier this year and is developing the technical skills of the company’s 1 300 workers based in the region. The simulator was developed by ThoroughTec Simulation, a company with more than two decades’ experience in offering technology-based training solutions. Nordgold explains that the Cybermine simulator creates the realistic sensation of driving the real vehicle at the actual mine, with all the correct visual, auditory and tactile feedback. Instructors are able to configure training scenarios to specific work situations faced on the individual mine site. The training centre’s facilities will also soon include a maintenance workshop covering 24 different types of equipment, such as engines and brake systems, and a welding section. These facilities will enable all workshop employees to further improve their skill sets, which are unique to their individual roles. The company also intends to provide training to local communities. Nordgold expects the total construction and fitting of equipment at the training centre to cost about $800 000. Nordgold human resources director Yulia Sklar says the training equipment will help enhance the skills of the company’s people, while enabling safer and more efficient operations in West Africa, where the company has mines in Burkina Faso and Guinea.
