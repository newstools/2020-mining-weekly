London-listed Central Asia Metals Limited (CAML) is considering reinstating the 2020 interim dividend during the fourth quarter, as the Sasa operation, in North Macedonia, has returned to full production following the September tailings leak. CEO Nigel Robinson said on Thursday that the Sasa site team had made good progress advancing the river remediation plans and that the company had worked closely with the local mayor and authorities to maintain their support during this period. Following receipt of the appropriate Ministerial approvals, the clean-up programme of the Kamenica river started in late October. Processing of ore restarted at 50% capacity on October 2. Following a trial period of about one week, processing was increased, and the flotation plant had now been broadly operating at full capacity for almost three weeks. CAML said that site management was satisfied with the engineering improvements made to TSF4, in line with the designer and Knight Pi√©sold's recommendations.
