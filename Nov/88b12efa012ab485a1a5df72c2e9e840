PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Queensland’s Hydrogen Minister Mick de Brenni has appointed two new Hydrogen Champions to back the state as the national hub for a job-creating hydrogen industry. Member for Mundingburra Les Walker and Member for Rockhampton Barry O’Rourke have been appointed to take over the roles in North and Central Queensland. They join Redlands MP Kim Richards as champions responsible for spearheading the development of the sought-after resource, to ensure Queensland is at the forefront of the emerging industry. “The government is focussed on Queensland’s economic recovery throughout the state, and we have already identified hydrogen as a job creating industry throughout Queensland,” De Brenni said. “I know that Walker and O’Rourke will do an excellent job alongside Richards to catalyse interest among hydrogen specialists, the business community and future workforces throughout the Sunshine state.” De Brenni said Queensland was the perfect candidate to mass produce green hydrogen from solar. “The world is increasingly looking to green hydrogen to fuel the future, and this government wants Queensland to be the supplier.”
