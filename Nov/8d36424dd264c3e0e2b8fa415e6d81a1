TSX-V-listed Kutcho Copper has begun work on a feasibility study for its high-grade Kutcho copper/zinc development project, located in north-western British Columbia. CSA Global Consultants Canada will lead the feasibility study and will be supported by a team of resource, geotechnical, environmental, metallurgical, processing and mining consultants. “With a significant amount of preliminary work already completed, and now the selection of CSA Global to lead the feasibility study, we look forward to an efficient and timely process in completing the next significant milestone in the life cycle of the Kutcho project,” states president and CEO Vince Sorace. The feasibility study should be completed in the second quarter of 2021. Kutcho completed a prefeasibility study in 2017 that demonstrated positive economics with an aftertax net present value of C$265-million and an internal rate of return of 27.6%. The mine will operate for 12 years at a 2 500 t/d production rate for total life-of-mine payable production of 378-million pounds of copper and 473-million pounds of zinc. On average, the mine will produce 33-million pounds a year of copper and 42-million pounds a year of zinc. The company completed the acquisition of the project in December 2017 with the support of Wheaton Precious Metals, involving a staged financing package of over $100-million.
