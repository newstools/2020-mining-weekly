Set to become an all-electric openpit mine, TSX-V-listed Nouveau Monde Graphite is advancing its procurement process for its fleet and charging infrastructure through an international call for prequalification. Original-equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and small and medium-sized enterprises have been invited to submit detailed proposals and performance specs for their production equipment solutions. The submission period is open from November 30, 2020, to January 30, 2021. The company says it is seeking the best zero-emission equipment for heavy-duty operations and the harsh conditions associated with openpit mining, whether powered by lithium-ion batteries, plug-in systems or hydrogen fuel cells. “Going all-electric is technically achievable, economically sound and environmentally responsible,” notes CEO Eric Desaulniers. “We are thrilled to be driving innovation and progress in our sector and hope to see our peers embark in this effort to minimise the footprint of the mining industry. Our initial market screening has already shown attractive technologies and ingenious mindset from OEMs that will enable us to achieve our carbon-neutrality promise to our community, shareholders and customers.” The Québec and Canadian governments are investing in cleantech through financial incentives, development programme and infrastructure to propel growth in the already-booming electric industrial hub. Nouveau Monde was recently selected as a partner to develop a new electric propulsion system with rapid recharging infrastructure adapted to heavy vehicles in the openpit mining industry.

The most advanced graphite project in North America, Nouveau Monde is targeting the launch of its commercial operations in 2023, with an allocated transition period to fully electrify its fleet by 2028.
