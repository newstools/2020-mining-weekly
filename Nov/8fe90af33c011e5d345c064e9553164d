PERTH (miningweekly.com) â€“ Coal developer Cokal has tapped PT Harmoni Panca Utama (HPU) as its preferred tenderer to provide contract mining services for the development and mining of its Bumi Barito Mineral (BBM) coking coal project, in Indonesia. HPU will be responsible for openpit overburden removal, the provision of the required mining fleet and associated equipment, and coal hauling from in-pit to a near out-of-pit intermediate stockpile facility. Cokal told shareholders on Monday that the appointment of HPU represented a significant milestone for the near-term development of BBM into a coal mine producing premium export quality coking coal and pulverised coal injection products. Cokal holds a 60% interest in the BBM project, which is expected to produce at a rate of two-million tonnes a year of saleable coal from its third year of production.
