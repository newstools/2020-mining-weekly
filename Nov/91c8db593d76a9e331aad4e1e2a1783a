The community blockade at the Los Filos mine, in Mexico, has been removed and access to the mine has been restored, owner Equinox Gold reported on Monday The Toronto-listed company said that Los Filos had begun a staged restart and was working toward achieving full operations in December. Workers would resume their duties only after testing negative for Covid-19. Mining activities at Los Filos have been suspended since September 3, owing to an illegal road blockade by members of the nearby Carrizalillo community. The individuals allege noncompliance with the community social collaboration agreement signed in 2019. Equinox said that representatives from the company had met regularly with the community leaders to discuss their concerns and that good-faith negotiations would continue in order to reach final agreement on remaining items related to benefits provided under the Carrizalillo social collaboration agreement.
