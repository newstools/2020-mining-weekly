PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Alicanto Minerals has reported a maiden resource of 500 000 oz at its Arakaka gold project, in Guyana. An independently calculated maiden resource of 9.1-million tonnes has been estimated for the project, grading 1.8 g/t gold for 520 000 oz of contained gold. The resource estimate stems from a review of the data collected by Alicanto and by previous owners Barrick Gold and Nordgold. Alicanto MD Peter George said the strong maiden resource was the start of what would likely be a rapidly growing inventory at Arakaka. “This resource is shallow, the mineralisation remains open in all directions, and we already have numerous intersections outside the resource which will form part of the next estimate. We also have multiple walk-up targets with multimillion-ounce bulk tonnage potential that remains to be drilled.”
