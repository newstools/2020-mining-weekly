PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Gold miner West African Resources has completed an early repayment of its $25-million debt finance facility with Taurus Funds Management. The company said on Friday that the early repayment of the debt was made without any penalties, and would provide West African with substantial future cost savings in relation to budgeted interest on the debt facility. The repayment has reduced West African’s debt facility principal from $200-million to $175-million. West African produced 45 719 oz of gold during the three months to September, an increase of 40% on the previous quarter as its Sanbrado operation, in Burkina Faso, continued to ramp up. The miner sold 44 184 oz in the third quarter.
