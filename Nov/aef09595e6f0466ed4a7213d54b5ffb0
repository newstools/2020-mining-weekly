Bullion miner AngloGold Ashanti has voluntary suspended operations at its Cerro Vanguardia mine, in Argentina, after Covid-19 cases were detected among the workforce. The mine would be shut for ten days and operations would resume on November 20, the South Africa-headquartered company said on Tuesday. The stoppage would have an 8 000 oz production impact. “AngloGold Ashanti is fully supportive of efforts to slow the spread of Covid-19 and is committed to working with and supporting the Argentinian government, particularly in the Santa Cruz province, to combat the virus,” the firm stated. None of its other operations were currently affected by Covid-19. AngloGold is expected to produce between 3.03-million ounces and 3.10-million ounces this year.
