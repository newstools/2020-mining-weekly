PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed PanTerra Gold officially started share trading as Antilles Gold after shareholders in October approved a name change. The company’s ASX code has been changed from PGI to AAU. The company is in the midst of a legal battle against the Ministry of Mines and Energy in the Dominican Republic over the Las Lagunas tailings treatment project, after the stored refractory tailings available for processing had amounted to around 4.9-million tonnes, which was substantially less than the 6.8-million tonnes presented as available by the government.
