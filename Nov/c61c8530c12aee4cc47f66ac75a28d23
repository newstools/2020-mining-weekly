PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Firefinch has announced an initial mineral resource estimate of 113 000 oz of gold at its satellite deposits N’Tiola, Viper and Domba, within its Morila gold project, in Mali. With the initial resource estimate of 2.5-million tonnes, grading 1.38 g/t gold estimated for the three satellite deposits, the combined measured, indicated and inferred resource estimate for the Morila project now stands at 39.3-million tonnes, at 1.17 g/t gold for 1.49-million ounces. Firefinch told shareholders on Tuesday that the satellite deposits are expected to underpin the initial phase of returning the Morila operation to full production. Drilling rigs are on site to carry out infill and extension drilling at the satellite deposits with the aim of improving the delineation and classification of material currently classified as inferred, as well as testing strike and depth extensions at each deposit. The mine is forecast to produce some 26 350 oz of gold from November 2020 to the second quarter of 2021, with the mine scheduled for closure in 2021. Firefinch has previously said that there was significant potential for near-term growth in production and mine life.
