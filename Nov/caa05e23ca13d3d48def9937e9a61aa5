The board of Central Asia Metals Limited (CAML) has recommended a 6p a share interim dividend, which will be paid on December 11. The London-listed company previously deferred a decision on an interim dividend, after the leakage from its Sasa tailings storage facility 4 (TSF4) in North Macedonia. “We appreciate the patience and continued support of our shareholders over the last two months. This period has been challenging for us but I am particularly proud of how our team has handled this issue and believe we can now look forward to better times ahead, having now reinstated our dividend and thereby underscored our long term intentions in this regard,” comments CEO Nigel Robinson. The board's confidence to recommend an interim dividend is as a result of Sasa's production having returned to 100% capacity over the last month, CAML says. The estimated cost for repairs and improvements also still remains under $1.5-million. Further, the river remediation process is progressing well, and the local community remains supportive of the company's clean-up efforts, the miner states. CAML has reported a rise in the number of Covid-19 cases at Sasa and in the town close to the mine, but says it believes the situation is being managed as well as possible.
