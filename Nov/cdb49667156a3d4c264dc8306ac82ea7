PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Medusa Mining has maintained its gold production guidance for the full 2021 at between 90 000 oz and 95 000 oz, despite a seven-day suspension of its Co-O gold mine, in the Philippines. The company in late October took the decision to suspend operations at Co-O, and to place the site on care and maintenance for a period of seven days after several members of the workforce tested positive for Covid-19. Operations at the mine resumed on November 3, with the project having been disinfected and the workforce screened to minimise the risk for any further infections on site. “Temporarily suspending operations was the correct decision and we believe the risk of the further spread of infection at site has now been minimized,” said chairperson and interim CEO Andrew Teo. “Our workforce has performed admirably in the circumstances, with operations running in line as planned upon resumption.” All-in sustaining cost estimates for the full 2021 have also remained unchanged at between $1 200/oz and $1 250/oz.
