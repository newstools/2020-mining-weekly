Canadian miner Teck Resources is funding a pilot project testing antimicrobial copper coatings on high-touch transit surfaces on buses and SkyTrain in Vancouver. The pilot project will run for an initial phase of four weeks with various copper surfaces installed on two buses on high-ridership routes and two SkyTrain cars. An organosilane surface preservative will also be tested that has the potential to control and/or prevent the growth of microorganisms on treated surfaces. Copper alloy surfaces are naturally antimicrobial with self-sanitizing properties, with research showing that these surfaces eliminate up to 99.9% of harmful bacteria and viruses. Teck has partnered with TransLink, Vancouver Coastal Health, VGH & UBC Hospital Foundation, Coalition for Healthcare Acquired Infection Reduction and the University of British Columbia. “This project builds on preceding research and will increase our understanding of the effectiveness of copper in killing organisms on frequently-touched surfaces. Positive findings will then be used to study the impact of copper on bacteria and viruses such as Covid-19 and norovirus,” says Vancouver Coastal Health medical microbiologist Dr Marthe Charles. “This holds future infection control benefits not only for the public in their travels, but for healthcare workers and patients who navigate their medical journey at Vancouver Coastal Health and beyond.” The project is the latest in Teck’s ongoing efforts to promote the use of antimicrobial copper surfaces in healthcare and public spaces.
