PERTH (miningweekly.com) – A preliminary economic evaluation of the potential for an openpit development at the Mon Ami gold deposit, in Western Australia, has prompted junior Great Southern Mining to apply for mining approvals during 2021. “We are pleased to announce that our in-house preliminary economic review has identified a potential low-cost development pathway for an openpit mining operation at Mon Ami,” said CEO Sean Gregory. “The planned drilling programme seeks to expand on this opportunity to test for higher grade extensions to the deposit at depth. Rapid development at Mon Ami has the potential to deliver a robust source of cash flow for Great Southern, allowing further acceleration of the aggressive exploration plans across our Australian gold portfolio.” Mon Ami is located on a granted mining lease and has a maiden inferred mineral resource of 1.1-million tonnes, grading 1.7 g/t gold for 59 000 oz of contained gold. A re-estimation of the mineral resource is also planned. Great Southern pointed out that numerous milling solutions existed within 150 km of the Mon Ami deposit, including the Granny Smith mill, some 10 km away. No commercial discussions with the mill owners are proposed until the development studies have been further advanced.
