Zambia's state mining arm ZCCM-IH plans to appeal a court decision that ruled in favour of Vedanta, which has sought arbiration in a dispute over the jointly owned copper mine that is facing liquidation, the mining minister said. "ZCCM-IH has already indicated that they are appealing because they are not happy with the court judgment," Richard Musukwa said.
