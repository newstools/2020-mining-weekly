Chilean miner Antofagasta has committed the Centinela and Zaldívar mines to commit to the Copper Mark – an assurance framework designed to hold the copper industry accountable to responsible practices. To be granted the Copper Mark, a producer must comply with 32 criteria relating to greenhouse gas emissions, safety and health, tailings management, biodiversity, business integrity, gender equality and human rights. "We are starting this important process at Centinela and Zaldívar and will then extend it to the rest of our mining operations,” says Antofagasta CEO Iván Arriagada. Once the Copper Mark has been granted, a producer must be independently assessed every three years to demonstrate continued compliance with all the criteria. Antofagasta VP of corporate affairs René Aguilar says the external independent review will assist the miner to continue improving its responsible mining practices.
