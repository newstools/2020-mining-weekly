Aim- and JSE-listed Gemfields has started a sales process for its 23.54% holding in Pallinghurst Ivy Lane Capital, which owns 27.64% of Sedibelo Platinum Mines (SPM), giving Gemfields an indirect interest in SPM of about 6.54%. SPM is incorporated in Guernsey and owns and operates the Pilanesburg Platinum Mines in South Africaâ€™s Bushveld Complex. Gemfields does not consider SPM as a core part of its strategy.
