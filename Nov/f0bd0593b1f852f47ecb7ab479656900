SANTIAGO – Chile's Spence copper mine, owned by BHP Group, said on Saturday it had struck an early deal with its union of supervisers on a contract that will run until November 2023. The company did not disclose details of the deal. BHP's Escondida copper mine in Chile also reached agreement with its supervisors last month, averting the threat of a strike at the world´s largest copper deposit.
