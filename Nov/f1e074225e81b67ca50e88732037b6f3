In ensuring it remains on track to achieve nameplate production of 60 t a month, tin miner AfriTin is continuing with the first stage of the Phase 1 production ramp-up of its pilot mining and processing facility at its flagship asset, the Uis mine, in Namibia. The company is targeting the processing of 45 000 t of ore a month, to produce 60 t of tin concentrate (36 t of tin metal) a month for the first stage. As a result, the miner produced 48.2 t of tin concentrate, containing 32.2 t of tin metal, in October – a 24% improvement on the previous month. The production level achieved in October represents about 90% of the first stage target on the basis of tin contained in concentrate. Tin concentrate production for the year to date totals 237 t. Plant availability and use have increased steadily which, combined with improved plant processing rates, yielded increased plant production. As such, AfriTin remains on track to achieve nameplate production of 60 t a month of tin concentrate by the end of the year. In terms of health and safety and any potential impact from Covid-19, the miner reports that because of its commitment to ensuring the health, safety and wellbeing of its employees, contractors and the local community, the company has reported no instances of positive Covid-19 cases at the Uis mine. Going forward, the miner also notes that Covid-19 mitigation measures remain implemented across its operations, with all necessary steps having been taken to safeguard the workforce. AfriTin CEO Anthony Viljoen says that, once nameplate capacity is realised, the miner will progress towards the second stage of Phase 1 − expanding its production levels even further. “AfriTin continues to remain well-positioned to take advantage of the improving tin market fundamentals, as it looks to achieve its vision of becoming a large-scale tin producer in Namibia.”
