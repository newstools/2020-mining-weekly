PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Lithium developer Piedmont Lithium will expand its current drilling campaign by an additional 25 000 m, the company said on Tuesday, with three additional drill rigs arriving over the coming weeks. “We are excited to be aggressively expanding our drill programme with five drill rigs soon to be in the field. Our dual objectives are to upgrade the current inferred resource within the core property to support our upcoming definitive feasibility study (DFS), while also growing the overall scale of our mineral resource tonnage,” said Piedmont president and CEO Keith Phillips. “The Carolina tin-spodumene belt is one of the world’s most prolific lithium belts and we are hopeful that we will ultimately delineate North America’s largest spodumene resource, ideally located in North Carolina to power North America’s clean energy storage and electric vehicle revolution.” Piedmont is planning to publish a mineral resource update for its project in the second quarter of next year, in support of an ore reserve and the completion of the DFS in mid 2021.
