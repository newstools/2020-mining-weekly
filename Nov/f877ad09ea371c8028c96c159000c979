The International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) has launched an interactive tool to help mining companies establish a clearer view of their assets’ levels of maturity on their journey to achieving sustainable mine closure. The closure maturity framework is designed to help companies map their current position, motivate improvement and measure the state of their operations’ progress towards sustainable closure. It outlines a pathway towards achieving desired post-closure land uses and closure vision, while considering relevant aspects of mine design, operations and technology. “Through the use of tools like ICMM’s closure maturity framework, companies are able to identify mine closure threats and opportunities from the earliest stages of mining so that these can be proactively managed and the risk reduced. It also makes it easier and more cost effective to achieve final closure objectives through effective integration,” says ICMM COO Aidan Davy. ICMM says that the closure maturity framework could serve as a communication tool that drives conversation between different business units and levels of a company to converge thinking and align decision-making. It can also facilitate the aggregation of results from multiple sites to enable companies to understand closure performance within a portfolio. Earlier this year, the ICMM published the key performance indicator (KPI) tool for closure, which is designed to help companies develop context-relevant performance indicators that drive accountability to support implementation of good closure practices at an operational level throughout the mine life cycle. The closure maturity framework and KPI tool were developed as practical tools to supplement those within the ICMM’s integrated mine closure guide, published in 2019.
