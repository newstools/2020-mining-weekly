PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Work at the Kambalda nickel operations, in Western Australia, has reached another milestone with the first firing of the portal face in the box cut at the new Cassini nickel mine. ASX-listed Mincor Resources said on Friday that the firing marked the start of development of the newest high-grade nickel sulphide mine in Australia. Furthermore, underground development has also started at the Northern operations. “Our transition to developer and re-establishment as a fully-fledged mining company is well under way and gaining momentum following the announcement of a final investment decision in September,” said Mincor MD David Southam. “In the space of just two months, we have achieved a significant amount, leveraging off the detailed planning we did at an early pre-development stage and our early engagement of the mining contractor. This strategy has paid dividends with all senior operational appointments already commenced and Pit N Portal fully mobilised to site with mining equipment ready to go.” The Mincor board in September this year approved the A$68-million development of the Kambalda project, with the project forecast to produce 71 000 t of nickel and 5 000 t of copper over a five-year mine life. First nickel in concentrate is scheduled for late in the first quarter of next year. Mincor and BHP Nickel West have recently agreed on terms for supply of grid power for the Cassini operations, with the company telling shareholders that the movement to grid power represents a change from the definitive feasibility study, where diesel generation was assumed. The switch is expected to result in savings of between A$7-million and A$10-million over the next five years.
