Bullion major Barrick Gold has appointed Anne Kabagambe, a former World Bank executive, as an independent director. Kabagambe served as an executive of the World Bank from 2016 to 2020, representing the interests of 22 sub-Saharan African countries, including Tanzania and Zambia where the company has operations. While at the World Bank, she sat on the development effectiveness committee, the budget committee and the pension benefits committee. Kabagambe also cochaired the World Bank boardâ€™s gender working group. Prior to the World Bank, she spent 27 years at the African Development Bank, where she built an extensive network within Africa and other parts of the world. Barrick executive chairperson John Thornton said Kabagambe would strengthen the board and bring an independent understanding of doing business internationally, informed by her experience in engaging with governments, the private sector and civil society and in particular her knowledge of the global resource, banking and education sectors.
