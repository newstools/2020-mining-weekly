PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Gold explorer Golden Rim Resources has reported a 43% increase in the Kouri mineral resource estimate, in Burkina Faso. The project is now estimated to host an indicated and inferred mineral resource of 50-million tonnes, grading 1.3 g/t gold for an estimated two-million ounces of contained gold, up 43% on the 2018 resource estimate. The indicated mineral resource estimate was up by 41%, to 310 000 oz, at 1.4 g/t gold. “The updated indicated and inferred mineral resource estimate of two-million ounces is substantially larger than the previous mineral resource and is a major milestone for the Kouri gold project,” said Golden Rim MD Craig Mackay. “An additional 600 000 oz of gold mineralisation was added to the mineral resource from a further 12 diamond drill holes and 235 reverse circulation drill holes. “Importantly, we have been able to increase our indicated resource by 41% to 310 000 oz. The company now intends to proceed with infill drilling, predominantly on the Central Lodes, with the objective of converting areas of inferred mineral resource to indicated mineral resource.” Mackay said that exploration drilling focused on high-grade gold areas, such as the Diabatou gold shoot, would be conducted with the objective of defining high-grade gold mineralisation that could be processed in the early years of a mine development.
