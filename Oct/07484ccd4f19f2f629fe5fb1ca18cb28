PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Gold miner Newcrest Mining has received conditional approval for its listing on the Toronto exchange, subject to meeting customary conditions before listing. The miner was expected to list on the TSX on October 13, but would retain its primary listing on the ASX, with a secondary listing on the PNGX markets. “A Northern American listing is part of our strategy by pursuing growth in the America’s following our 70% acquisition of the Red Chris mine in Canada in 2019, and our investments in Ecuador,” said MD and CEO Sandeep Biswas. “We have observed an increase in interest from North American investors in the gold sector over the last six months. When combined with our large existing North American shareholder base, it makes sense for Newcrest stock to be able to be traded in this time-zone. “We believe the TSX listing will improve the global visibility of the company and broaden our access to the large North American capital pool,” Biswas said.
