PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Construction has started at the wet screening plant for the Riley iron-ore mine, in Tasmania. Project owner Venture Minerals on Friday said that the successful completion of the initial mining and dry screening operations produced some 2 000 t of high specification product, with the current mine economics of the project trending well above the 2019 feasibility numbers. “Venture’s board has committed to Stage 1 of the wet screening plant construction as part of its continued ramp up towards full scale production. The iron-ore price remains strong, and the company remains focused on determining the best mining and screening method at the Riley mine to reduce costs and environmental impact so that we can generate jobs, contracting opportunities and returns to our shareholders,” said Venture MD Andrew Radonjic. As part of the wet screening plant construction phase, all required long lead items for Riley have also been ordered.
