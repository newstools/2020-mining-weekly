PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Metals miner Independence Group has reported increased nickel, copper and gold production for the first quarter ended September from its Nova and Tropicana operations. Nickel production from the Nova mine, in Western Australia, increased by 1% on the fourth quarter of 2020, to 7 276 t, while copper production from Nova was up by 2%, to 3 278 t. The company said on Thursday that the Nova operation benefitted from a continued focus on cost discipline and production efficiencies, with cash costs during the quarter improving by 17%, to A$2.25/lb. Meanwhile, gold production from the Tropicana operation was up by 5% on the June quarter, to 107 060 oz, owing to higher tonnes milled and consistent recoveries.

Underground ore mined in the quarter totalled 136 500 t, for 14 637 oz of gold mined. Independence on Thursday reported that group revenue for the quarter was largely in line with the previous quarter, at A$226.6-million, which cash production costs tracked in line for both Nova and Tropicana.
