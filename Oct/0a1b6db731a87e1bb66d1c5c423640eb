Canada-based Premier Gold Mines has announced solid production results for the third quarter from its fully-owned Mercedes mine, in Mexico, and its 40%-owned South Arturo mine, in Nevada. Consolidated gold production for the third quarter exceeded 19 000 oz. Mercedes’ 12 183 oz of gold beat the mine’s new operating plan for the quarter and the 7 096 oz from South Arturo joint venture with Barrick ensures that production is already more than the yearly plan. Improved production from the Mercedes mine was a result of implementing a modified mine plan developed during the Covid-19-related care and maintenance period in the second quarter. "Consolidated production in the third quarter met the high-end of expectations,” stated Premier CEO Ewan Downie. "The modified mine plan at Mercedes, designed to increase mining efficiency and expand operating margins, has resulted in significantly enhanced cash flow." Mercedes also produced 49 985 oz of silver produced in the quarter.
