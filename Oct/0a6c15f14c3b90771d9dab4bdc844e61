Brazilian miner Vale has restarted its Viga concentration plant, in Minas Gerais, after a judge on Thursday lifted an order that had suspended operations at the plant. Operations were halted for six days, while the company addressed issues relating to its operating permit. The Viga plant has the capacity to produce 11Â 000 t/d of iron-ore fines.
