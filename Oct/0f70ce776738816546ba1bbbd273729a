London-listed Chaarat Gold on Thursday moved to reassure investors that its projects in Kyrgyzstan remain unaffected by this week’s post-election protests that plunged the country into political chaos. While the gold mining company’s projects had not been materially impacted, Chaarat said it had nevertheless taken preliminary measures to ensure the safety of its personnel and operations. Earlier this week, protestors tried to break into the office of Centerra Gold’s Kumtor Gold Company in the capital Bishkek, according to news reports. Newswire Reuters also reports that London-listed Kaz Minerals had suspended production at its Bozymchak copper and gold mine. On Wednesday, Prime Minister Kubatbek Boronov quit and was replaced by Sadyr Japarov, who was freed from prison by protesters. Opposition groups this week seized control of Parliament, saying Sunday's ballot had been rigged. The BBC reports that the election results have been annulled.
