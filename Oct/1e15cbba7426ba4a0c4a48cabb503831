Aim-listed gold developer and explorer Hummingbird Resources has now drilled over 21 509 m this year, and is 95% through its budgeted $5-million drilling and exploration programme for 2020. The exploration and drilling programme is set to further refine Hummingbird’s mine expansion plans and show the potential for increased resources at its Yanfolila operation, in Mali. Hummingbird plans to publish a mineral resource update after the programme is completed. CEO Dan Betts says this year’s drilling and exploration programme has seen greenfield targets produce some significant drill intersections which is “always exciting” for a company. The company’s chief geologist Murray Paterson, meanwhile, confirms that Hummingbird is preparing strategies for the 2021 exploration drilling programme, as the company “looks to take advantage of the solid results from this year”.
