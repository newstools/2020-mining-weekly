Canadian gold exploration and development company Gowest Gold has received the last environmental permit needed to bring its Bradshaw prospect, which is part of the North Timmins gold project, into commercial production. The company reported on October 28 that it had received official notice from the Ontario Ministry of Energy, Northern Development and Mines that the mine production closure plan had received final review and filing in accordance with the Ontario Mining Act. The closure plan provides details on how the Bradshaw mine will be operated and closed, and how the site will eventually be reclaimed once mining activities are completed. The Bradshaw prospect contains a National Instrument 43‐101 indicated resource estimated of 2.1-million tonnes, grading 6.19 g/t gold, containing 422 000 oz of gold and an inferred resource of 3.6-million tonnes, grading 6.47 g/t gold, containing 755 000 oz of gold. Based on a prefeasibility study produced in 2015, Bradshaw contains mineral reserves in the probable category, using a 3 g/t cut‐off and a gold price of $1 200/oz, totalling 1.8-million tonnes, grading 4.82 g/t gold for 277 000 oz of gold.
