PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The South Australian government this week launched its hydrogen prospectus, detailing three hydrogen hubs that it is hoped will position the state at the forefront of hydrogen production and export. Energy and Mining Minister Dan van Holst Pellekaan said on Thursday that the prospectus showed that South Australia’s wind and solar resources could underpin the state’s international competitiveness as an exporter of clean hydrogen to Asia and other regions. “Hydrogen is shaping up as a game changer in the fight against climate change and our aim is to get the cost down so that it’s a commercially attractive option for heavy transport, power generation and use by industry. “The prospectus reveals that South Australia can become a national and international exporter of clean power, while achieving the goal of net 100% renewable energy.” The three hubs are located at Port Bonython, Port Adelaide and Cape Hardy/Port Spencer, with the hub at Port Bonython capable of exporting industrial-scale green hydrogen around Whyalla and Port Augusta. Van Holst Pellekaan is expected to launch the government’s Hydrogen Export Modelling Tool and the prospectus during the state’s Clean Energy Month webinars. “This is a key step in our plan to make South Australia a consumer and exporter of clean hydrogen. This prospectus and tool builds on the government’s hydrogen action plan, which was released in September last year. “This new prospectus and modelling tool cement our credentials as a world-class place to do business and leading renewable hydrogen producer and supplier to the world.”
