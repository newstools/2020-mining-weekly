Gold miner Kirkland Lake has reported new drill results from 135 holes (47 683 m) of underground exploration drilling from the Macassa mine, aimed at confirming and extending resources in the SMC, LSMC and Amalgamated zones. Resources within the Amalgamated zone consist of a series of mineralised lenses first identified by drilling in 2019 which are located on the south side of the SMC and adjacent to the Amalgamated break. “Today’s results are encouraging as they support our view that there is substantial exploration potential in areas where the dip of the SMC approaches the contact with mineralised zones stacked vertically along the Amalgamated break. These are separate areas of gold mineralisation coming together, which is very interesting, and what we are seeing are some extremely high-grade intersections,” said Kirkland Lake president and CEO Tony Makuch. The results also expanded the mineralisation at depth in the LSMC and identified new areas of high-grade mineralisation along the Amalgamated break, further increasing confidence that there were new mineral reserves to be discovered as drilling continued along the break through the Kirkland Lake camp, he added. The new intersections around the SMC and along the Amalgamated break followed results that Kirkland issued in April, identifying a large corridor of high-grade mineralisation in close proximity to the #4 Shaft location, located at depth along the Main break below the former mine workings on the Kirkland minerals property. “In combination, our drilling at Macassa this year has been successful in all three key areas of our exploration programme: continuing to grow and expand the SMC, confirming the considerable exploration potential of the Amalgamated break and demonstrating that there are significant ounces yet to be discovered, and mine life to be added, along the historic Main/’04 break.” One of the holes (427 m) completed during the programme (57-992) was collared in a platform on the north side of the 5 700 level and drilled in a south-westerly direction to test the margin of the SMC. The hole intersected 253.7 g/t over 14.5 m, including 1 572.9 g/t over 0.6 m, 1 313.5 g/t over 0.3 m and 1 265.1 g/t over 0.6 m near the planned target location and slightly below the current mineral reserve for the SMC. The new intercept is also located between 9 m and 39 m west of three previously unreported intercepts from the SMC including 101.1 g/t over 4.1 m from 57-704, 100.1 g/t over 2.0 m from 57-689 and 37.7 g/t over 3.6 m from 57-703, as well as four additional high-grade intercepts located immediately north of the Amalgamated break. One of these four Amalgamated zone intercepts is a new result and included 68.2 g/t over 2.3 m from 53-3053, while the other three intercepts had been previously reported and included 429.1 g/t over 3.3 m from 57-704, 164.8 g/t over 3.0 m from 57-689 and 26.7 g/t over 2.0 m from 57-703. A total of 54 of the new holes (22 204 m) of drilling from the new programme were drilled northwards from platforms on the 5 300 and 5 700 levels and were designed to infill and expand inferred mineral resources near the west limit of the LSMC. Key intercepts from the drilling include 33.3 g/t over 2.0 m, including 177.6 g/t over 0.4 m, from 53-4114, 32.1 g/t over 2.0 m, 22.0 g/t over 3.2 m and 20.2 g/t over 2.0 m from 53-4116A, 31.8 g/t over 2.0 m from 53-4120, 24.6 g/t over 2.1 m from 53-4118, and 19.3 g/t over 3.2 m and 22.8 g/t over 2.0 m from 53-4162, which are from holes targeting inferred mineral resources and untested gaps in drill information on the upper west side of the LSMC. Additional key intercepts from this area include 103.3 g/t over 2.4 m, including 542.0 g/t over 0.3 m, from 57-903, 58.9 g/t over 2.2 m from 57-879, 49.5 g/t over 4.3 m, including 164.9 g/t over 1.2 m, from hole 57-975 and 41.2 g/t over 2.0 m and 38.0 g/t over 2.1 m from 57-976. These intersections are from holes designed to infill and expand inferred resources on the lower west portion of the LSMC structure. An additional 80 holes (47 688 m) of drilling from the new programme were drilled southwards from platforms on the 5 300, 5 600 and 5 700 levels to confirm and expand current inferred resources within the Amalgamated zone near the current west limit on the 5 300 levels. Significant results from the drilling include 11.0 g/t over 2.4 m from 53-4040, which was drilled near the top of the current resource, as well as 210.4 g/t over 8.2 m, including 463.0 g/t over 3.7 m, from 53-4033, 52.9 g/t over 2.0 m, including 172.3 g/t over 0.6 m, from 53-4041 and 35.4 g/t over 2.0 m from 53-4045, which were drilled 50 m to 60 m up dip. Additional significant results include 48.2 g/t over 2.0 m, including 317.6 g/t over 0.3 m, from 57-900, 20.2 g/t over 2.1 m from 57-902, 13.5 g/t over 3.0 m from 57-895 and 13.2 g/t over 2.0 m from 57-975, which were drilled mainly to infill an untested gap in the east part of the current inferred resource, as well as 8.3 g/t over 9.0 m from 56-777, 14.4 g/t over 2.4 m from 53-4027 and 12.9 g/t over 2.0 m from 53-4039, which were drilled near the west edge of the current resource and extended mineralisation by another 25 m. “Based on the latest results, and the large areas remaining to be tested along strike and dip, the potential to identify new areas of high-grade mineralisation along the Amalgamated break remains excellent.” Exploration drilling at Macassa is currently continuing with nine drills underground and one drill on surface. Drilling over the balance of the year will remain focused on testing the SMC and Amalgamated zones.
