PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Diversified miner BHP has agreed to a set of shared principles around Aboriginal heritage with the First Nations Heritage Protection Alliance, aimed at enhancing the influence and voice of traditional owners in relation to heritage protection. The miner on Tuesday said that the principles also reaffirm a shared commitment to self-determination for Aboriginal peoples, their right to speak proudly and publicly about their culture and their heritage; and recognition that building a better understanding of Aboriginal cultural heritage in Australia is ongoing. In addition, BHP has set a commitment for Aboriginal cultural heritage keeping its place in Australia to better reflect traditional owners’ values, culture and pride. First Nations Heritage Protection Alliance co-chair Kado Muir said he was confident the work with BHP would lead to improved cultural heritage protection across Australia. “We have been heartened by the constructive approach BHP have adopted to our discussions with them.  Together we are determined to drive industry reform and legislative change that improves both agreement making and the protection of Aboriginal cultural heritage which is of immense value to all Australians,” Muir said. BHP’s agreement comes amid an ongoing Parliamentary inquiry into fellow miner Rio Tinto’s destruction of 46 000-year-old caves in the Pilbara region of Western Australia.
