Mineral explorer Cornish Lithium has appointed Varshan Gokool, who most recently was president and CEO of Euromax Resources, as CFO. At Euromax, Varshan was pivotal in leading the Ilovica-Shtuka copper/gold project in North Macedonia from inferred resource to definitive feasibility study, implementing a financing strategy for its construction and managing permitting matters and stakeholder engagement. Prior to Euromax, Varshan led and implemented the financing strategy of European Goldfields Limited, a mining company headquartered in London, but listed on the TSX with copper, gold, lead and zinc mines in Greece and Romania.
 
“We are delighted to welcome Varshan to the executive team at Cornish Lithium and I believe that he can bring significant financial acumen, financial strategy and optimisation and governance to the company.

“We look forward to capturing Varshan’s wealth of financial and mining experience in order to assist Cornish Lithium in the next stage of its journey towards commercial production and the creation of a battery materials hub for UK industry,” said Cornish Lithium CEO and founder Jeremy Wrathall.
