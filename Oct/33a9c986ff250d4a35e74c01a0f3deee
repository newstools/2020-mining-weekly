Toronto-listed Ascot Resources has signed an agreement for the delivery of the semi-autogenous grinding (SAG) and ball mills, which are critical path, long lead time equipment items required in the refurbishment of the concentrator facility for restarting the past producing Premier gold mine, in British Columbia's Golden Triangle. The company has signed an agreement with Montreal-based Farnell-Thompson Applied Technologies for delivery of the SAG and ball mills and related parts to the Premier mill site. The order comprises a 22-foot-diameter by 8-foot effective grinding length SAG mill and 14.5-foot-diameter by 19.5-foot effective grinding length ball mill. Both mills will be driven by 2 000 kW, low speed synchronous motors at 78% critical speed. The mills will be supported on 90-inch-diameter hydrodynamic trunnion bearings which will be interchangeable. The mill lube systems will be identical for both mills.
