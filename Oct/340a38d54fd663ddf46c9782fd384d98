Joint venture (JV) partners Barrick Gold and NovaGold have completed an 85-hole drilling campaign at Donlin Gold, advancing the Alaska gold project up the value chain. Assay results for the first 25 holes, representing 30% of the 23 400 m drilled, have been received. NovaGold CEO Greg Lang said that the results continued to exceed modelled grade-thickness, with higher grades over narrower intervals. “With the industry burning through reserves and grades continuing to decline, great drill results with even higher-than-modelled grades are exciting for any mining company - and we believe that to be particularly true for Donlin Gold at this late stage of development,” he said in a statement. Some of the latest results include DC20-1877 that intersected 4.17 m grading 80.6 g/t gold, starting at 123.48 m drilled depth, including a sub interval of 3.15 m grading 106.2 g/t gold, starting at 124.50 m drilled depth. DC20-1888 intersected 6.93 m grading 43.1 g/t gold, starting at 178.58 m drilled depth, including a sub interval of 3.25 m grading 90.5 g/t gold, starting at 180.26 m drilled depth. Barrick CEO Mark Bristow added that a comprehensive geological understanding of an orebody was a foundational step that few companies in the gold industry do well. “With an orebody the size, scale and quality of Donlin Gold it is of even greater importance in order for the project to successfully deliver maximum value for all our stakeholders.” Data from the 2020 drill programme will be incorporated into an updated model, which could be further verified with additional drilling.
