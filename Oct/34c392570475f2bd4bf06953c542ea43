Underground mining activity has resumed at the 777 mine, in Flin Flon, Manitoba, and production should be back at full tilt in December, base metals miner Hudbay Minerals reported on Monday. Operations at the copper/zinc/gold/silver mine were halted earlier this month, after a skip fell to the bottom of the shaft during routine maintenance. Hudbay completed a preliminary video inspection of the mine shaft, which indicated that the damage was limited to the headframe and the bottom of the shaft in the skip compartment. The company said the cage compartments, ore loading area and structural integrity of the shaft appeared to be intact. An in-person inspection of the shaft and skip compartment would be done early in November. Hudbay said the repairs could be done for under $5-million. While fourth-quarter production and sales volumes would be impacted, the company is still expecting the Manitoba business unit to achieve its full year production and unit cost guidance for 2020. The 777 mine – Hudbay’s former flagship mine –  is approaching the end of its mine life after 15 years. Final production is anticipated in 2022.
