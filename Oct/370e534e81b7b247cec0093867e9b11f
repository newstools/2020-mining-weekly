Steve Higgins, senior VP and chief administrative officer of US-based Freeport-McMoRan, has been elected chairperson of the International Copper Association (ICA) and chairperson of the LME’s copper committee. ICA is a nonprofit organisation with 35 members, including Freeport-McMoRan, that brings together the copper industry and its partners to support markets for copper and to make a positive contribution to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. The LME copper committee is an advisory committee to The London Metal Exchange with the primary purpose to maintain oversight of the copper product specifications and to ensure that the contract represents the industry’s needs. “We recognise Steve for his expanded roles in these important organisations supporting the global copper industry. He is a valued member of our Freeport leadership team. With his wealth of experience, Steve is highly respected within our company, by our customers and broadly in the global copper industry,” said Freeport McMoRan president and CEO Richard Adkerson.
