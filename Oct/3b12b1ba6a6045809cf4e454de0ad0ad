PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The board of gold miner Resolute Mining has started the hunt for a new CEO after MD and CEO John Welborn handed in his resignation. Welborn has been at the helm of Resolute for five years. CFO Stuart Gale has been appointed as interim CEO while an executive search process is undertaken. “Welborn has worked hard to reposition and transform the business over the past five years, and the time is right to introduce a new CEO to take Resolute forward, to deliver improvement in operational outcomes and resilience, and to deliver the next phase of sustainable value for the company,” said chairperson Martin Botha. “Under his leadership, Resolute has been active corporately to build its mining profile and dual list on the London Stock Exchange. On behalf of the board, I would like to thank him for his valuable contribution and wish him well in his future endeavours.”
