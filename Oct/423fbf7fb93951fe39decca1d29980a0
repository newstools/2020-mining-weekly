London-listed Xtract Resources says it has not been served with any legal proceedings or restraint orders related to its Kalengwa processing project, in Zambia. This follows Zambian media reports questioning the legal ownership of the mining licence related to the project. Xtract says the almost 1 000 km2 licence in question, covering cobalt, copper, diamonds, gold, iron-ore, lead, malachite and silver,Â was issued in April 2019, with an expiry date of April 1, 2023. The Kalengwa processing project comprises the processing area, tailings dumps and a flooded openpit, as well as 500 m of surrounding area north and south of the pit.
