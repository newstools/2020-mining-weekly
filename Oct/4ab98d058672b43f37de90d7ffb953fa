The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) says it has declared a wage dispute with Assmang Operations, in the Northern Cape, after it was unable to reach a wage settlement with the iron-ore and manganese miner. The union initially demanded a 15% increase access the board, but lowered its demands to a 9% increase in wages for B Band members and 7.5% for C Band members. The NUM says Assmang maintained its offer of a 5.4% wage increase. The union referred its dispute to the Council for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration and a conciliation meeting had been scheduled for October 20. The union says it has embarked on a mobilisation process among its members, preparing for a protected strike.
