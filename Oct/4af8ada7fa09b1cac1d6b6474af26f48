Tanzania will receive about $40-million from Barrick Gold Corp on October 13 as part of a payment settlement with the company. President John Magufuli will oversee the event, the ruling CCM party said in a statement. It’s part of the $300-million settlement between Tanzania and Barrick Gold to end a tax dispute. Barrick Gold paid the first installment of $100-million in May.
