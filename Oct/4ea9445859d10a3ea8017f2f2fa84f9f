PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Gold hopeful Ora Banda Mining has reported a maiden inferred resource estimate of 650 000 t at the Riverina South project, in Western Australia. Grading at 2.1 g/t gold, the project is estimated to host some 43 000 oz of gold. The Riverina South project includes the Riverina South extension and the British Lion prospect, and is located to the immediate south of the planned Riverina openpit, which forms a part of the larger Davyhurst gold project. “We are pleased to deliver this maiden mineral resource estimate for Riverina South. This area has been targeted as part of our ongoing resource replacement and growth strategy due to its high prospectivity and close proximity to the main Riverina mining area,” said MD David Quinlivan. “This is the first step in increasing the potential mine life at Riverina and our programme is to now continue with an upgrade to the resource classification and ultimately toward defining the potential of this area to add to the Riverina ore reserve base.” Ora Banda has previously told shareholders that first gold pour at the newly restarted Davyhurst project is targeted for the first quarter of 2021. The project is expected to produce some 81 000 oz/y of gold over a mine life of an initial five years, and would require a capital investment of A$45-million.
