TSX-V- and AltX-listed Alphamin Resources Corporation says its tin sales for the quarter ended September 30 were up 3% quarter-on-quarter to almost 2 700 t. The company expects to reported earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation of $16-million for the quarter. Despite producing 6% less contained tin in the September quarter, at 2 563 t, compared with 2 739 t produced in the June quarter, Alphamin remains on track to meet its production guidance for the last quarter of the year, which is set at between 2 600 t and 2 800 t of contained tin. Alphamin advises that its run-of-mine volumes processed increased by 5% quarter-on-quarter to 96 086 t, while underground mining performed well in delivering increased material for processing. On average, the tin grade achieved in the quarter under review was 12% lower, compared with the prior quarter. The company indirectly owns 84% of the Namibia-based Bisie tin mine’s operating subsidiary. Alphamin will release financial statements for the September quarter on or about November 2.
