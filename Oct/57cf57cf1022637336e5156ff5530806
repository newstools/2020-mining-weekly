LSE- and ASX-listed Pensana Rare Earths COO Dave Hammond will be stepping downÂ with effect from January 1, 2021. Hammond has been with the company for the past three years. His experience in technical resource definition and exploration has seen the culmination of the substantial upgrade to the mineral resource estimate at the Longonjo project, in Angola, a key element underpinning the bankable feasibility study that is under way. The company will be looking to update the market in the near future regarding new appointments to the board.
