PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Iron Road and the joint developers of the Cape Hardy Stage 1 port development, in the Eyre Peninsula, have welcomed the port’s inclusion into the South Australian government’s hydrogen plans. The South Australian government earlier this week launched its hydrogen prospectus, detailing three hydrogen hubs that it hoped would position the state at the forefront of hydrogen production and export. The three hubs are located at Port Bonython, Port Adelaide and Cape Hardy/Port Spencer, with the hub at Port Bonython capable of exporting industrial-scale green hydrogen around Whyalla and Port Augusta. Cape Hardy is being developed by Iron Road, the Eyre Peninsula Cooperative Bulk Handling (EPCBH) and Macquarie Capital, and is the only deepwater multi-commodity port being considered in the hydrogen export study. “We welcome the release of the state government’s hydrogen prospectus and its recognition of the strategic importance that the region can play in the state’s export future,” said EPCBH CEO Tim Scholz. “As a true multi-commodity deepwater port, we have consistently promoted the ability of Cape Hardy to deliver not only to the region’s grain growers, but also to the wider Eyre Peninsula community. “The release of this prospectus further demonstrates that a multi-commodity port is the best option for the Eyre Peninsula. Our project can deliver that and support growth in the region,” said Scholz. The planned export facility at Cape Hardy is designed to be South Australia’s first Capesize capable port, and will be developed over a number of stages. The Stage 1 port will be predominantly used for grain export, with third party access for the import and export of various other commodities. The port is planned to have an initial shiploader capacity of 70-million tonnes a year.
