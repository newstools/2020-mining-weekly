SANTIAGO – Negotiations between Canada's Lundin Mining and the union at its Candelaria copper mine in Chile are making slow progress in their bid to avoid a strike at the deposit, the head of the mine's union told Reuters on Saturday. Canada's Lundin Mining requested government mediation late last month in a last-ditch effort to stave off a strike by one of its unions after failing to reach a contract deal. The mine's union of 350 members had rejected the company's latest offer on September 28, leaving negotiations at a stand-still. "Progress is slow. If no agreement is reached by Wednesday the 7th (of September), the strike will take effect," union president Patricio Gárate said in a message. Candelaria produced 111 400 t of copper in 2019 and had reached 65 400 t as of July this year. Chile is the world's largest producer of the red metal.
