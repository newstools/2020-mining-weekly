PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Coal miner TerraCom on Thursday told shareholders that it had achieved a 17% operating cost reduction at its Blair Athol mine, in Queensland, since transitioning to owner-operated at the end of July. “The transition to owner-operated occurred at the end of July 2020 and despite previous projections for a reduced coal sales production profile of two-million tonnes a year, the team has outperformed initial expectations,” said CEO Danny McCarthy. “With an enhanced mine plan, optimised workforce numbers and significantly reduced cost base, Blair Athol has achieved an annualised coal sales run rate of 2.4-million tonnes a year for the September quarter. “Since taking over the Blair Athol operations as owner-operator, the company has identified a number of operational efficiencies and refinements within its mining process which have delivered exceptional results. Compared to the 2020 financial year, the company has reduced annualised coal sales from Blair Athol by only 109 000 t, or 4.2%, yet at the same time refined the operating costs per tonne resulting in more than a 17% reduction.” McCarthy said that performance across all operations has continued to be strong in a challenging market environment, with TerraCom maintaining its focus on delivering results. “Across all operations, the company is well positioned to achieved managed annual coal sales in excess of 10.2-million tonnes for the full year ending June 2021.”
