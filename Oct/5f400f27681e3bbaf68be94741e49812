Minerals producer Kenmare Resources has announced that the wet concentrator plant (WCP) B at Kenmare Resources’ Moma titanium minerals mine, in northern Mozambique, has started production at the Pilivili ore zone, ahead of schedule. WCP B and its dredge were relocated 23 km from their previous mining location of Namalope to the high-grade Pilivili ore zone. Following the move, the plant and dredge were floated across the Mualadi river and into the starter pond. Mining was previously targeted to start only in the middle of the fourth quarter. “The move of WCP B represents the final stage of our growth programme and we are well-positioned to produce 1.2-million tonnes per annum of ilmenite from 2021. This is expected to deliver expanded margins and increased free cash flow generation, with the opportunity for stronger shareholder returns,” comments MD Michael Carvill.
