Aim-listed BlueRock Diamonds has sold 2 900 ct of diamonds recovered from its Kareevlei mine, in the Kimberley region of South Africa, at an average price of $300/ct for an aggregate consideration of $870 165. “This is the third successful private sale conducted through an agent in South Africa at a price we consider competitive in the current market, demonstrating the consistent strong demand for our high-quality diamonds from long-standing customers. "We will continue to update the market with upcoming sales both through private sales in South Africa and also our previously announced plan to export directly which remains a key objective for BlueRock,” says BlueRock executive chairperson Mike Houston.
