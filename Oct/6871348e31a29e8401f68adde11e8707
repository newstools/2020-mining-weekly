TSX-V-listed Trillium Gold has received assay results from the first four holes of its recent 3 186 m drill programme on the Newman Todd property, in Red Lake, which confirmed high-grade gold mineralisation over significant widths, including 15.41 g/t. Hole NT20-169 intersected 15.41 g/t gold over 7.05 m, starting at 226 m downhole in the Newman Todd zone in geology favourable for hosting high-grade gold mineralisation. Hole NT20-167 intersected 8.63 g/t gold over 6.55 m. "These initial drill intersections at the Newman Todd zone are highly encouraging. The potential for Newman Todd to host additional high-grade mineralisation is very exciting given we are surrounded by several producing and past producing mines in one of the most prolific gold camps located in Red Lake,” commented Trillium CEO Russell Star. “These results highlight the significant potential of our exploration programme on the Newman Todd target that has not undergone any drilling since 2013. By drilling perpendicular to, and in the opposite direction from, the majority of historical drilling, we have intersected meaningful high-grade gold mineralisation over substantial widths, a major success for Trillium shareholders." The Newman Todd zone is currently a 2.2-km-long and up to 200-m-wide structural target which is part of the Red Lake Gold Camp. The early success of the exploration programme has provided the company with enough confidence to restart drilling.
