PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Coal miner New Hope has called on the Queensland government to "immediately approve" expansion plans at the New Acland coal mine, after the A$1-billion Olive Downs coal mine was given leave to develop. New Hope Group COO Andrew Boyd said the recent approval of the Olive Downs mine west of Mackay was surprising. “We were staggered by the Premier’s appearance in Mackay recently where she announced the approvals for Olive Downs. It is a great announcement for the resources sector, but also confusing given the project is currently subject to a judicial review in the Supreme Court. “Our workers and the Darling Downs community are wondering why one project can be approved while legal matters are unresolved while another, New Acland Stage 3, can’t.” Boyd said the approval of Olive Downs confirmed that the state government was not required to wait for court orders to approve resource projects. Boyd said the loss of 175 jobs at site in the past year has had a devastating effect on the local economy. “More than A$26-million in wages have been lost to the local economy. We also have A$60-million in machinery parked up, gathering cobwebs. “We just want the Premier to be fair, to be consistent and to treat us equally, not like second-class citizens who don’t matter.” New Hope subsidiary New Acland Coal currently operates the existing New Acland mine as a 4.8-million-tonne-a-year opencut coal mine, however, the mine’s reserves are depleted. The Stage 3 expansion project will increase the mine’s yearly output to 7.5-million tonnes and will extend the operation’s life by some 12 years beyond the current end-date of mid-2020.
