The Baita Plai polymetallic mine, in Romania, is operational once more, Aim-listed Vast Resources reported on Wednesday. Underground mining operations have restarted, following a short suspension of operations for refurbishment work on the transport link between the mine and the plant. Mining is currently carried out between levels 17 and 18, with blasted ore being transported to the flotation plant ahead of the hot commissioning of the plant, which will follow shortly. Vast confirmed that its production plans for October remained on track. The company in September forecast that the processing plant would process 14 116 t of ore and that it would deliver 281 t of payable copper-equivalent in the fourth quarter. “The swift action our team took to reconnect the mine and flotation plant meant that production was able to resume quickly, resulting in minimal downtime and, importantly, no expected impact on October production and sales targets,” said CEO Andrew Prelea. Vast in September advised the market of a safety issue at the railway bridge access point between the mine and the flotation plant, that caused a delay of three to four weeks to the first sale of concentrate.
