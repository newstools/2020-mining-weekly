PERTH (miningweekly.com) – First gold dore has been produced at the White Dam gold/copper heap leach operation, in South Australia. ASX-listed joint venture (JV) partner GBM Resources on Monday said that first gold had been poured by its JV counterpart Round Oak Minerals. “While recent rain has resulted in some minor delays, the additional water is set to drive increased heap leach irrigation and thus higher gold and copper production in the near term,” said GBM MD and CEO Peter Rohner. “We are now working to finalise shipping of the first copper concentrates once the concentrate drying process is completed. The sulphidisation-acidification-recycling-thickening (SART) plant is meeting its design objectives of removing copper and increasing the recovery of the cyanide solution back into the circuit to increase gold recoveries, which together enhance the overall economics of the White Dam operation.” The SART plant and associated copper concentrate production continues to ramp up in line with expectations, and the JV partners have identified optimisation opportunities that are likely to drive further expanded production and reduced costs. The parties are also evaluating the estimated remaining resource of 4.6-million tonnes, containing some 101 900 oz of gold, to determine the viability of extracting and leaching this material.
