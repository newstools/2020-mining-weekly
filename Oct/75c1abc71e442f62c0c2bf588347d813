About 350 workers at the Candelaria mine, in Chile, will down tools, after mediation with the Candelaria Mine Workers Union ended without an agreement, Canada-based Lundin Mining reported on Wednesday. The strike is starting on Thursday. The company said that it did not expect a material impact on Candelaria’s operations, including production or shipment of concentrate, as a result of labour action. The previous collective agreement with the union expired on September 30, 2020. Meanwhile, as part of the collective bargaining cycle, Candelaria is also in a legislated negotiation process with the Candelaria AOS Union, which represents about 550 members.  An agreement was reached with the LMC AOS Union during negotiations in May. Collective bargaining with the two remaining unions, which combined represent about 230 supervisors, would start late this month.
