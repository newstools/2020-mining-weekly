PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed junior FYI Resources has completed a high purity alumina (HPA) production trial at its pilot plant in Western Australia. The objective of the trial was to produce stipulated end production specially tailored to the requirements of targeted potential customers and to incorporate several previously noted process design modifications into the production flowsheet. Samples of the HPA product from the trial will be submitted for analysis to EAG Laboratories, in the US, for independent, high accuracy confirmation of HPA grades. The trial was a culmination of process improvements noted from previous piloting and the objective of targeting the HPA end product to specifications stipulated by several prospective offtake groups,” said FYI MD Roland Hill. “While we are yet to receive the analysis, I believe we achieved our goal after observing the final product. This exercise bodes well with our continuing discussions with potential offtake parties and other project stakeholders, including financiers.” A previously complete definitive feasibility study into the HPA project estimated that some 8 000 t/y of HPA could be produced from the integrated operation over a mine life of some 25 years, at a capital cost of $198-million. The integrated project is expected to generate annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation of $133-million and cash flows of $88-million.
