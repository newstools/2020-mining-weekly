PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Junior Fenix Resources has awarded a A$185-million contract to fellow listed MACA for drill and blast, mining, and crushing and screening activities at the Iron Ridge project, in Western Australia. Early stage works at Iron Ridge started in September, and MACA is currently mobilising heavy earthmoving equipment to site. Openpit mining and crushing and screening operations are expected to start in the current quarter. “We have been interacting with MACA on all aspects associated with the Iron Ridge project for well over a year now, and we are pleased that this relationship will continue as we transition to production in the near term,” said Fenix MD Rob Brierley. “MACA has vast experience in all aspects of iron-ore mining operations and has essentially offered Fenix a one-stop shop for all of our service requirements leading up to the transport of ore from site to the Port of Geraldton.” A 2019 feasibility study estimated that the Iron Ridge project would produce some 1.25-million tons a year over a six-and-a-half-year mine life, and would require a capital investment of A$11.9-million.
