TSX- and NYSE-listed Yamana Gold started trading on the LSE’s main market on Tuesday. Founder and executive chairperson Peter Marrone said that there were compelling reasons to invest in the Canada-based gold producer. “We offer gold exposure via a high-quality, long-life asset portfolio in the Americas, organic production growth, a commitment to providing and increasing cash returns to shareholders, and a commitment to adhering to high ESG [environmental, social and governance] standards.” The LSE listing of the company’s shares provides investors with access and exposure to five precious metal producing mines, with a production platform of about one-million gold equivalent ounces (GEO) expected in 2021 and 2022, within a low production cost structure. The company also has a portfolio of advanced development projects, highly prospective exploration properties and strategic investments throughout the Americas, including in Canada, Brazil, Chile and Argentina. Yamana has a track record of delivering cash returns to shareholders, with dividends having accumulated to almost $1-billion since it first starting paying dividends 13 years ago. Last week, Yamana announced that it would increase its yearly dividend by a further 50% to $0.105 a share, effective for the fourth quarter. At the new rate, the dividend will be 425% higher than the dividend level 18 months ago. The company has also established a policy of representing the dividend on a per GEO basis, with the objective of maintaining the dividend at between $50/GEO to $100/GEO. This increase positions the dividend at the high end of the range at $100/oz.
