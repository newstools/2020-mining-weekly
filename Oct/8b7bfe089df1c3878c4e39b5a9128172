PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Red River Resources has reported record copper production from its Thalanga operation, in Queensland, during the quarter ended June. The miner on Friday told shareholders that copper production for the September quarter reached 4 073 t, which was a 51% increase on the 2 697 t produced in the previous quarter. Thalanga also produced 7 026 t of high quality zinc concentrate and 1 947 t of high quality lead concentrate for the September quarter, as the project achieved stable mine production and mill throughput. Red River acquired the Thalanga operation in 2014, and started production at the West 45 deposit in 2017. Production from West 45 ceased in 2020, and ore for the operation is currently being sourced from the Far West underground mine, with Red River planning to develop the Liontown deposit to extend the mine life.
