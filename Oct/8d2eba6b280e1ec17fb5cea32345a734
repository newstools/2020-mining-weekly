Aim-listed IronRidge Resources has recorded final high-grade drilling results from the second phase drilling programme at the Ebilassokro and Ehuasso targets, both within the Zaranou gold project area in Côte d'Ivoire Final high-grade reverse circulation (RC) and aircore (AC) drilling results (from the previously reported 4 m composites on September 17) have been received for the remaining 1 m primary samples over the Ehuasso target, including highlights reported at a 0.1 g/t cut-off and maximum 1 m of internal dilution. Mineralisation continuity is now confirmed over a 1.7 km strike at the Ehuasso Main target, with mineralisation open to the south-west and at depth. Follow-up Phase 3 infill RC drilling is now under way, with three drill rigs active on site at the Ehuasso, Ebilassokro, Yakassé, Mbasso and Coffee Bean targets. “Zaranou continues to deliver for the company, with all second phase drilling results now received for a total programme consisting of 22 389 m of combined AC and RC drilling. “Ehuasso Main is our most advanced target area, with mineralisation continuity now defined in 160 m spaced AC and RC drill traverses over 1.7 km strike and up to 70 m of apparent thickness, drilled to a maximum vertical depth of 100 m which remains open along strike and at depth,” comments CEO Vincent Mascolo. He notes that drilling, to date, at Ehuasso has intersected both narrow high-grade and broad low-grade intervals within both weathered and fresh zones. “Our early ounces strategy is to target weathered oxide mineralisation, with initial observations suggesting it continues to average depths of 50 m and up to 90 m, suggesting simple mining and processing at low operational and capital costs. “Encouraging results have also been returned at the Ebilassokro target where heel-to-toe AC traverses along existing tracks have intersected high-grade mineralisation, including 5 m at 270.5 g/t at surface within a high-priority soil anomaly exploration target,” Mascolo enthuses. He says that, with only 12 km of 47 km of potential strike having been drill tested to date, the company has uncovered three exciting target zones – Ehuasso, Yakassé and Ebilassokro – with additional targets M’Basso and Coffee Bean/Super Pit complementing an additional untested 8 km strike of hard-rock artisanal workings and 27 km of untested soil anomalies to deliver a pipeline of further discoveries.
