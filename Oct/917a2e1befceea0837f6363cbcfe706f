TSX-V-listed GoviEx Uranium has started a diamond drill core assay programme on the Falea deposit, in Mali. The objective of the sampling programme is to investigate the polymetallic and precious metals potential of the deposit below the uranium-bearing sandstone unconformity. Another sampling survey that the company conducted earlier this year highlighted the potential for gold at the project, hence the new core sampling programme to advance this theory. The initial sampling programme analysed 96 diamond drill cores that displayed intervals of quartz veining, chalcopyrite and pyrite in many of the samples. While the development of the Madaouela uranium project, in Niger, remains GoviExâ€™s primary focus, the company continues creating value for shareholders from all its projects. An announcement by GoviEx on July 6 disclosed the results of a gold geochemical sampling programme at the Falea project, with significant gold in soils anomalies in the Birimian rocks, which suggest the potential extensions of the Siribaya West and the Siribaya-Bambadinka gold trends through, and potentially intersecting within, the Falea project. The presence of these gold in soils anomalies occurring along similar structural trends with the Falea project, positively signals the mineral potential of the project, which the company is now further exploring through the current core sampling programme.
