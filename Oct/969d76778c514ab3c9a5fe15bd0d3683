JSE-listed potash development company Kore Potash has received authorisation from the Congo-Brazzaville Department of Tourism and Environment to start with the planned drilling programme for the definitive feasibility study (DFS) for the company’s DX project. Kore, which owns 97% of the Kola and DX potash projects in the Sintoukola basin, in the south-west of Congo-Brazzaville, now has all government approvals required for the planned DFS work programme. As such, Kore has received written authorisation for the drilling of up to five additional drill holes in the Dougou permit area, which encompasses the DX deposit. This authorisation also confirms that the conditions of the Environmental Conformity Certificate for the Dougou permit area, dated March 31, with a duration of 25 years, will continue to apply. The drilling programme is designed to improve confidence in the mineral resources and ore reserves of the DX deposit. The drill holes are designed to intersect the targeted potash seams about 400 m below surface. The sylvinite seams at DX are at shallow depths compared with other potash deposits globally, Kore notes. The drilling will be undertaken using drill rigs and equipment that the company owns and that are on site at the Sintoukola camp. Key personnel have been mobilised to site and the drilling programme remains on track for commencement of drilling before the end of October. Kore CE Brad Sampson thanks the government of Congo-Brazzaville, which he says continues to actively support the development of Kore’s projects in the Sintoukola basin, for reviewing this application and responding quickly. “We have seen improvements in the DX project as each phase of work has progressed and we are excited to be moving forward with the DFS,” concludes Sampson.
