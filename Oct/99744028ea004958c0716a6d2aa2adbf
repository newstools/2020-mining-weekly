Toronto-listed Titan Mining has announced high-grade zinc mineralisation in the Mahler zone of its Empire State mine, in upstate New York, which CEO Don Taylor says will ultimately extend mine life and enhance its production profile. Highlights from the underground drilling include 17.6 ft assaying 45.4% zinc within a larger zone of 24.1 ft assaying 36.5% zinc, as well as 9.8 ft assaying 41.1% zinc within a larger zone of 20.8 ft assaying 25.5% zinc. “Our drilling continues to deliver positive results that will ultimately extend mine life and enhance our production profile. In the case of Mahler, we are seeing some very substantial zinc grades over mineable widths. As we progress with the exploration moving farther away from the mine workings, we have high expectations of success," says Taylor. The current Empire State mine drilling, in two drill fans consisting of 13 drill holes, has extended the Mahler mineralisation over a down-plunge strike length of 350 ft. An additional 40 holes are planned to further test another 500 ft of potential strike length by the end of the fourth quarter. Titan will use the results from the current and pending drill programme to refine the current mine plan, in preparation for development in the fourth quarter of 2020.
