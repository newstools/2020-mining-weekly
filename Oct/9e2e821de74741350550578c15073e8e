The Minerals Council South Africa, “shocked” to hear of the murder of mining community leader Fikile Ntshangase, extends its “deepest condolences” to her family and colleagues. She was shot at her home in Northern KwaZulu-Natal on the night of October 22. The organisation states that it cannot be certain about the motives of her killers. “However, it is inevitable that there would be suspicions that her murder was linked to her work related to mining developments in the area,” it notes. As such, the Council advocates engagement with civil society organisations, including groups representing communities in the vicinity of existing and proposed mining operations, with the social licence to operate being critical for any such operation. “Constructive and peaceful efforts by all stakeholders to consult over possible adverse impacts of mining should be part of such engagements,” states the council.
