JSE-listed diversified miner Exxaro Resources has clarified that negotiations to sell its 24.4% interest in Black Mountain Mining (BMM) are still ongoing, despite media reports claiming that the saleÂ process has been finalised. Exxaro previously said zinc mining was not strategically aligned to its long-term objectives and, therefore, initiated a sales process to sell its interest in BMM. The company did disclose that negotiations were at an advanced stage.
