LSE- and Nasdaq-listed Afarak Group has reported that its group production for the third quarter of the year at 40 766 t was 60.1% lower than the 102 219 t produced in the third quarter of 2019. This was owing to reduced mining activity in South Africa, the protection of staff amid Covid-19, low market prices and poor demand, as well as lower volumes from the company’s Turkish mines. Particularly, slow demand for low-carbon ferrochrome resulted in lower production at the company’s EWW plant, in Germany, as well as increased shutdown periods to manage stock levels. The company produced 1 359 t of speciality alloys, while it produced 547 t of ferroalloys. Afarak’s processing volumes decreased in both segments by 79.2% year-on-year during the third quarter of the year, while mining activity decreased by 58.2%, for both these segments, year-on-year. Afarak operates the Stellite and Mecklenburg mines in South Africa, as well as the Mogale processing plant. In Turkey, it operates the Kavak and Tavash mines, while it has the EWW processing plant in Germany.
