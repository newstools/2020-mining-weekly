The Oyu Tolgoi mine, in Mongolia, has been awarded the Copper Mark – the industry's new responsible production programme. Oyu Tolgoi has met more than 30 criteria for responsible environmental, social and governance (ESG) operating practices, Rio Tinto-controlled Turquoise Hill said on Tuesday. The Copper Mark is the first programme for responsible production in the copper industry. Originally developed by the International Copper Association with inputs from a broad range of stakeholders including customers, nongovernmental organisation and producers, the Copper Mark is an independent entity with a multi-stakeholder council. "At Turquoise Hill, we are fully committed to responsible production and transparency at Oyu Tolgoi," said Turquoise Hill CEO Ulf Quellmann. Rio Tinto's Kennecott site, Utah, was the first producer to be awarded the Copper Mark.
