SANTIAGO – The suspension of operations at Chile's Candelaria copper mine continued on Friday with no sign of a resolution in a contractual dispute between the company and two workers' unions, the parties said. Canadian miner Lundin denounced road blockades and illegal force used by striking workers, while the unions denounced the company's intransigence in seeking a solution. The company said in a brief statement that it would not contemplate resuming negotiations without a cessation of violent protest activity. It suspended its operations on Oct. 20, when a second union announced it would strike after failing the negotiations on a new collective contract faltered. Between them, the two unions have 1 000 workers. "There is nothing new," Patricio Garate, president of the Mina Syndicate, the first to initiate the strike on Oct. 8, told Reuters. To avoid roadblocks and protests, the company has been bringing staff necessary for essential maintenance in by helicopter. The company told Reuters last week that operation would resume "only once it is possible to have the necessary guarantees for the safety of all workers." It remained willing to achieve a negotiated solution in the conflict, it added, but "the basic conditions of mutual respect, good faith and the rule of law must be met." The mine produced 111 400 t of copper in 2019.
