Gold junior Galane Gold says Canadian miner B2Gold has terminated the earn-in option agreement relating to certain exploration properties in Botswana, after none of the targets identified met the size criteria of the larger miner. Galane CEO Nick Brodie says, however, that the targets that B2Gold identified at the Mupane exploration properties could represent significant targets for Galane. “Once we have had time to digest all the information that they have created, we will prioritise each of the targets and we expect to put our own exploration programme together to progress them. "In the context of a much higher gold price and greatly improved position for Galane Gold since we originally entered into this option agreement, we are very excited to pursue these opportunities directly as we continue to develop Mupane’s long-term plans,” he comments in a statement.
