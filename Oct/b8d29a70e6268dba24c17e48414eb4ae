PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Diamond miner Lucapa Diamond Company has reported a 280% increase in the indicated resource at its Mothae kimberlite diamond mine, in Lesotho. The project is now estimated to host a Joint Ore Reserves Committee- (Jorc-) compliant indicated resource of some 9.2-million tonnes, containing around 280 000 ct of diamonds at a diamond grade of 3.10 carats per hundred tonnes (cpht). The project is also estimated to host a Jorc inferred resource of 39.4-million tonnes, containing some 960 000 ct of diamonds at a head grade of 2.44 cpht. “The updated Mothae resource is the result of significant work undertaken to increase the resource and classification of Mothae following almost 16 months of mining and treatment through the new commercial plant,” said MD Stephen Wetherall. “The increase in tonnes and carats, the classification of some 280 000 ct into indicated resources category at an estimated diamond value of $635/ct strongly supports expansion in production at Mothae that the partners are considering.” The 1.1-million-tonne-a-year Mothae operation started production in January of last year, and produced more than 30 000 ct in its first year of operation, including three stones of more than 100 ct each.
