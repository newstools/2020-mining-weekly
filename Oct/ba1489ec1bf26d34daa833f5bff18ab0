TSX-V-listed Avidian Gold Corp started trading on the OTCQB Venture marketplace (OTCQB), effective October 28. “Avidian’s key areas of interest are advanced-stage gold projects located in the US in two of the best mining jurisdictions in the world – Alaska and Nevada. "Listing on the OTCQB will increase exposure in the US and make trading in Avidian stock much more accessible to US investors. Our goal in the last quarter of 2020 and throughout 2021 is to continue to increase visibility in the US where we know there is a high level of interest in domestic gold exploration and Avidian,” chairperson and CEO David Anderson says. Avidian owns the Amanita and Amanita NE projects in the Fairbanks mining district, as well as the district-scale Golden Zone project in Alaska. It also owns the Jungo gold/copper project located in the Humboldt Trend of north-western Nevada.
