PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Major Rio Tinto will invest $51-million on upgrading facilities at its Vaudreuil alumina refinery, in Quebec. The company said this week that three new energy efficient buildings are under construction and existing facilities will be rearranged to provide close to 400 employees with a centralised control room, offices and common areas once complete in early 2021. The upgrades will move employees away from industrial processes and bring six separate control rooms into one centralised location with advanced reporting technologies, improving the efficiency of operations, communications and decision-making. "This investment will provide our employees with an even safer and more modern work environment, as we optimise our operations at the Vaudreuil plant. We’re pleased to be partnering with union representatives and contractors to ensure this project not only delivers a more efficient operation, but also generates significant economic benefits in the region,” said Rio executive director Quebec operations Sébastien Ross.
