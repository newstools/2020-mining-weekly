PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Copper developer Orion Minerals has launched a high-impact exploration programme at its Prieska project, in South Africa, to test prospective near-mine and regional targets. “We have compelling drill targets right across our Areachap tenement holdings in the Northern Cape that we have been itching to test but have not been able to, because of the lockdown requirements for the responsible management of the Covid-19 pandemic,” said Orion MD Errol Smart. “With South Africa finally moving to Lockdown Level 1 from September 21, we are absolutely delighted to be in a position to finally resume exploration field work after a nine-month suspension. Our management team has used the lockdown period to progress licensing and access agreements, and we are now about to recommence an exciting new phase of exploration across the belt.” Smart said that any new discoveries in the near-mine environment or further afield across Orion’s Areachap licences would benefit from their proximity to the infrastructure planned for the brownfield mine. “Our exploration team believes there is exceptional potential both to grow production and extend mine life, both within the mine itself and in the surrounding tenements. We believe there is also potential for a major nickel/copper/cobalt/platinum mine at Jacomynspan, 65 km north of the Prieska project.” Drilling has started with two diamond rigs operating at the Kielder project, some 15 km from the planned mill, with Orion planning for a total of ten diamond drill holes totalling 1 800 m and nine reverse circulation drill holes totalling 64 m planned for this campaign.
