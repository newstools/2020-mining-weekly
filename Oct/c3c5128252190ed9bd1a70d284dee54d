PERTH (miningweekly.com) – New data by the Queensland Resources Council (QRC) has shown that an additional 50 000 jobs have been created in the resources sector over the past financial year, with the mining, gas and energy industries now employing some 420 000 staff. The QRC on Monday noted that the three sectors added a record A$82.6-billion to the Queensland economy in 2019/20, representing a A$5-billion increase on the year before. QRC CEO Ian Macfarlane said the latest data shows one in every five dollars in the state economy and one in six jobs are due to the Queensland mining and gas industry, highlighting the significance of the sector to every Queenslander’s hip pocket. “The overall number of jobs supported by resources in Queensland has risen by 13% since June last year, increasing from 372 000 to 420 000-plus people now working across our sector,” he said. “Of these, 52 676 people are directly employed in resources and a further 367 493 jobs are supported by the sector, which emphasises the significant flow-on benefits to the wider community from having a strong resources industry in Queensland. “This is more important than ever as Queensland businesses continue to battle the headwinds of Covid.” The number of Queensland businesses directly supported by mining, gas and energy companies rose by 5% since June last year from 14 400 to reach 15 199, with companies reporting a 19% increase in spending during this period. “On top of the billions of dollars resources contributes to the state economy each year, our companies also pay Australia’s highest royalty tax rates, which collected A$4.5-billion last year for the Queensland government,” Macfarlane said. “This money goes directly into the state budget to fund teachers, nurses, doctors, hospitals, schools and roads so that gives billions of reasons for voters to back candidates who support the resources sector.”
