Aim-listed Arc Minerals has announced the first set of assay results from the laboratory confirming the presence of near-surface copper mineralisation at the Fwiji prospect, in Zambia. The first Fwiji drill results have confirmed significant mineralisation, the company notes. High-grade sulphide mineralisation has been intersected. Arc noted good thicknesses and grades including the highest-ever 7% copper grade intersection. Visual appraisal of the subsequent holes has confirmed further mineralisation at Fwiji. "The initial drilling results at the Fwiji prospect have once again surpassed our expectations with evidence of significant sulphide and oxide mineralisation and, more importantly, showing continuity across a distance of over 1 000 m from the first hole drilled. This is the first major sulphide discovery in our three years of drilling which is very exciting,” says executive chairperson Nick von Schirnding.
