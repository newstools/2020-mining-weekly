Uranium project developer Denison Mines has increased the size of its bought deal offering to 47-million shares, for aggregate proceeds of $17.4-million. The company previously planned to raise $10-million through a 27.03-million-share offering at $0.37 a share. The underwriters and joint book runners are Cantor Fitzgerald Canada and Haywood Securities. Denison granted the underwriters an over-allotment option exercisable, in whole or in part, to purchase up to an additionalÂ 7.05-million offered shares at the issue price for potential additional gross proceeds of $2.6-million. Proceeds of the offering would fund the evaluation and environmental assessment activities on Denison's Wheeler River project, as well as for general working capital purposes.
