Monte Aguila – the new name for Newmont Colombia, which is 50:50 owned by Newmont and Agnico-Eagle – has paid P$2.52-billion (about $650 000) to dual-listed Orosur Mining to fund exploration at the Anza project, in Colombia. Orosur says its Colombian subsidiary, Minera Anza, and Monte Aguila have developed detailed exploration plans to restart field work at Anza once restrictions and risks associated with Covid-19 have subsided sufficiently. The parties hope to get geophysical surveys and drilling under way by early November. Geophysical equipment should be imported soon and discussions with drill contractors are under way. “Clearly the Covid-19 pandemic is presenting challenges to remote exploration that were not expected at the start of the year. However, the operating protocols that we have established are allowing our diligent and professional staff to plan and implement as near to a full exploration programme as could be achieved under these trying circumstances,” says Orosur CEO Brad George. The company reports that refurbishment and expansion of the camp is nearing completion, additional technical staff are being recruited, the necessary community and government notifications have been made, while the required permit applications have been submitted.
