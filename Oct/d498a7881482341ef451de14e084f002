Fury Gold, the Canadian gold developer created through Auryn Resources’ acquisition of Eastmain Resources, has been launched, with Ivan Bebek as chair, Mike Timmins as CEO and Elizabeth Senez as interim CFO. The company has appointed former senior Newmont exploration geologist David Rivard as its exploration manager. Rivard previously oversaw exploration on Newmont's Quebec-based assets, including the Eleonore mine region. From 2013 to 2017 he was the regional geologist for Eastmain and he is already familiar with several of Fury's James Bay gold projects. Fury owns a 100% interest in the Eau Claire project, which hosts one of five known deposits in the Eeyou-Istchee/James Bay region of Quebec. Newmont’s Eleonore mine is 57 km north of Eau Claire. At Eau Claire, a 50 000 m drill contract, which is planned to start in early November, has been awarded to Groupe Roullier. Fury says it will provide a drill targeting update based on the work completed over the summer, prior to the start of the drill programme. Meanwhile, Fury appointed Saga Williams to the board of directors of the company. Williams has worked in Indigenous communities for over 20 years in government and corporate roles in the capacity of legal counsel, negotiations and governance, and as a strategic adviser. She is Anishinaabe, a member of Curve Lake First Nation and is currently an elected official for her community. Shares of Fury are expected to start trading on the NYSE American on Monday, October 12, and on the TSX on Tuesday, October 13.
