TSX-V-listed Giyani Metals Corp expects the Botswana Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA) to approve the scoping and terms of reference (SToR) for its K Hill manganese project later this quarter. The environmental- and social-impact assessment (Esia) approval by the DEA is a two-stage process, with the approval of the SToR marking the completion of the first stage. The SToR contains a series of preliminary field and desktop assessments and consultations with the local community leadership in Kanye, government departments, nongovernmental organisations and other relevant stakeholders. The results from the first stage will form the structure of the main report, which will be developed and compiled during the second stage. The SToR was submitted to the DEA on August 25 and the DEA provided comments on the initial submission in early October. Giyani, working with Botswana-based Loci Environmental, responded to the comments on October 26. "We would like to thank Loci Environmental and the Botswana DEA for the continued progress in the Esia despite the logistical challenges imposed on everyone by the global Covid-19 pandemic. Despite this, we have been able to complete a substantial amount of work, enabling us to move the project forward with minimal delay,” comments Giyani CEO Robin Birchall.
