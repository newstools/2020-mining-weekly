BERLIN - The European Union will seek to establish rules to trade hydrogen with countries including Morocco and Ukraine, as part of its plans to use the low-carbon fuel to cut emissions from industry and transport, EU energy commissioner said on Monday. "To trade renewable and low-carbon hydrogen reliably across borders, we will need proper rules," Kadri Simson said, pointing to the two countries as a first step for establishing this. The EU will also put hydrogen on the agenda in its talks on energy with the US, Japan and South Korea, Simson said in a web cast.
