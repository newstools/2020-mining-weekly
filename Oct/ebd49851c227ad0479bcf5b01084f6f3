PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Western Australian Mines and Petroleum Minister Bill Johnston is still looking for uptake of the state's A$13.2-million incentive plan to attract a global cathode active materials production facility for lithium-ion batteries. The state government in August announced the funding incentive, which forms part of a greater A$92.4-million suite of incentives to activate new industries and create a jobs pipeline. The cathode active manufacturing initiative includes incentives to offset project costs, such as land lease rates on industrial land to help businesses establish and keep local jobs in Western Australia. “We would love to talk to someone that would like to invest in that space. The government is very keen to see further processing of nickel metal here in Western Australia to take advantage of the strength we have as a world leader in the processing of metals,” Johnston said at the Paydirt Nickel conference, in Perth. “We have the technology, we have the skilled workforce, we have the materials available, we have the site that we would like to see the manufacturer establishing, and we would support it with this incentive package.”
