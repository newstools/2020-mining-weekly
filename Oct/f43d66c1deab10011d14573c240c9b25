The UK Royal Mint has expanded its Queen’s Beasts coin series with the debut of the 2021 White Lion of Mortimer. The 1 oz platinum bullion coin brings the total number of platinum coins in the series to eight, with a further two in the Royal Mint’s pipeline. The Queen’s Beasts series, now in its fifth year, was launched in recognition of Queen Elizabeth II becoming the world’s longest-serving monarch in 2016, having acceded to the throne 64 years previously, with coins in the series depicting the subject of heraldry, legend and legacy in a contemporary interpretation. The 2021 1 oz platinum bullion coin design features the White Lion of Mortimer standing beside a shield bearing the distinctive white rose of the House of York. Both the coin’s obverse and reverse were created by iconic coin designer Jody Clark.
