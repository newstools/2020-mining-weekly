Toronto-listed Nevada Copper has appointed former Glencore executive Mike Ciricillo as acting CEO to take over from Evan Spencer. The company explains that Covid-19-pandemic-related delays in obtaining work permits have restricted the ability of Spencer – an Australian mining executive – to relocate to Nevada. Spencer was appointed president and CEO in May, replacing former Barrick Gold and Rio Tinto senior manager Matt Gili. Acting CEO Circillo was previously the head of copper industrial operations for Glencore, where he oversaw the commodity trader and diversified miner’s worldwide copper assets. Prior to Glencore, he has held a number of senior management roles during a 20-year tenure with Phelps Dodge and Freeport McMoRan, including as president of Tenke Fungurume Mining and GM of Miami Arizona Operations. Ciricillo joins a maturing senior management team, with the recent appointments of Andre van Niekerk as CFO and Dale Ekmark as COO. Meanwhile, Nevada Copper also announced the appointment of Kate Southwell to the board of directors, replacing Phillip Day, who has stepped down from the board. Southwell is currently a VP at Pala Investments, and has previously worked at Nyrstar and Shearman & Sterling.
