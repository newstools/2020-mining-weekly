SAO PAULO â€“ Brazilian miner Vale has teamed up with China's Zhoushan Port Company to build and operate Project West III in the port of Shulanghu, according a securities filing on Friday, a strategic logistics alliance to serve the world's largest iron-ore importer. Vale said it will have 50% of the JV, adding the port project expansion will demand multi-annual investments of about $624 million. Both partners plan to obtain financing for up to 65% of the project, the filing said. The West III Project consists of expanding the facilities at the Shulanghu Port, developing a storage yard and loading berths with an additional capacity of 20-millions of metric tones per year. By participating in the project, Vale said it will guarantee a total port capacity of 40-million tonnes a year in Shulanghu, which will help Vale to optimise costs in its value chain, according to the filing.
