Aim-listed diversified miner Alba Mineral Resources says its senior geologist Mark Austin has agreed to take up the full-time position of COO, in addition to serving as senior geologist. He will be responsible for overseeing the day-to-day operations of the company’s mining projects in north Wales, Greenland and Ireland. Alba specified that this was not a board position, while lauding Austin’s significant management and operational experience across a four-decade career in a statement on October 28. “He has been instrumental in the swift progress that has been made at Clogau gold mine, in Wales, over the past months. “Austin comes with a huge amount of experience working for major mining companies, including hands-on experience in managing all aspects of the development of a gold mine in Africa from exploration through to the building of a processing plant and the ultimate export and sale of gold bars," says Alba chairperson George Frangeskides. He has previously served as nonexecutive director of Central Rand Gold, as geologist for fellow-listed Goldplat and CEO of Goldplat's Kilimapesa Gold subsidiary, as well as exploration VP for Mano River Resources.
