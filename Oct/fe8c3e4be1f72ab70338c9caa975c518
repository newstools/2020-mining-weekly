Aim-listed Botswana Diamonds (BOD) has started with a precision ground geophysics programme to define potential kimberlite pipes on its Marsfontein and Thorny River prospects, in Botswana. The company is focusing on four high-potential targets to finalise early drilling. The four targets include the largest and most prospective of the anomalies as reported by a detailed assessment by UK group Subterrane. Drilling on all the prospective targets will start in November. Meanwhile, the company is also undertaking a detailed ground geophysical survey over the Marsfontein alluvial deposit, following an independent assessment of the potential for diamondiferous alluvial deposits in the area by the chairperson of the SamCode Standards Committee and a recognised export in the geology of diamondiferous alluvial deposits Professor Tania Marshall. BOD has appointed Geofocus to undertake a combination of ground gravity, electromagnetic and magnetic surveys to help delineate kimberlite dykes.
