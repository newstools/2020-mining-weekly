JSE- and NYSE-listed precious metals miner Sibanye-Stillwater has undertaken several organisational structure changes, including the promotion of several members of staff to enhance delivery and strategic focus. Business development executive VP Richard Stewart has been promoted to group COO, effective December 1. He joined Sibanye in 2014 and has been instrumental in executing the group's external growth and business development strategies, according to the company. Stewart has over 20 years’ experience in the mining sector and holds a Phd in geology. Laurent Charbonnier will succeed Stewart as business development executive VP. He has more than 20 years’ experience in investment banking and recently left his role as HSBC metals and mining global head and MD, which he occupied for the last eight years. Charbonnier was a lead adviser to Sibanye on the acquisitions of Aquarius Platinum, Rustenburg, Stillwater and Lonmin and their related financing. Following the death of Chris Bateman on September 6, South African platinum group metal operations executive VP Wayne Robinson has been appointed Montana operations executive VP. Robinson has worked in the South African gold and platinum mining sectors for more than 25 years. Legal and compliance senior VP Lerato Legong, who joined the group early this year, has been promoted to legal and compliance executive VP. He has served both in private practice and as in-house counsel in the mining industry over a 17-year period. Group CEO Neal Froneman says Sibanye has come a long way since the listing of Sibanye Gold in 2013. “We are a close knit and strong team that has grown through our experiences. I am confident that these changes in the executive team will further bolster our ability to deliver value as we execute our strategic intent of ensuring operating excellence across the group.” He adds that the organisational transition is ongoing and he looks forward to providing further clarity in due course.
