PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Artemis Resources has raised A$5.78-million following the sale of its 1.64-million shares in TSX-V listed Novo Resources. Artemis on Tuesday told shareholders that an average sale price of C$3.40 had been achieved per share. The four-month escrow stock was issued to the company in April this year, at a price of C$2.06 a share. “We are pleased to have been able to complete these share sales in a structured and responsible manner to yield nearly A$5.78-million to put back into treasury. This non-diluted funding will only strengthen our hand as we embark on a particularly busy, multi-programme phase of exploration across our Pilbara portfolio,” said Artemis executive director Alastair Clayton. “We also have additional noncore asset divestments that are expected to close imminently,” he added.
