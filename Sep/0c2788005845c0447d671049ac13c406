PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Diamond miner Lucapa has generated A$3.2-million in revenue from the sale of diamonds from its Lulo alluvial mine, in Angola. The ASX-listed company on Thursday told shareholders that 3 477 ct of Lulo diamonds had been sold at an average price of A$911/ct. Sales for the year to date reached A$23.2-million, with 12 266 ct sold at an average price of A$1 892/ct. Lucapa MD Stephen Wetherall said that the Lulo mine had delivered strong operational performances soon after restarting operations, following the Covid-19-related lockdown. “Although the average diamond size in this sale parcel was smaller than average, the encouraging signals being seen in the industry currently have led to upward price movements across a number of diamond categories. That, together with the record recoveries from the Ieziria areas, suggest Lulo should have a much improved second half of 2020.”
