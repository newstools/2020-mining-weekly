Dual-listed Resolute Mining has warned of a potential ten-day strike by employees at its Syama mine, in Mali. The gold miner has received a strike notice from the Union Nationale des Travailleurs du Mali SOMISY-SA, informing it that the union members will strike if certain demands are not met. The company notes that the principal demand is a request for it to reinstate employees who have been stood down on full pay as a result of the company's Covid-19 protocols. "Resolute has implemented a comprehensive, company-wide response to the coronavirus pandemic. This response prioritises the health, safety and wellbeing of employees, contractors and stakeholders, while recognising our responsibility to mitigate the impact of Covid-19 on all aspects of our operations. "At Syama, a decision has been made to limit the travel of non-essential workers from outside the surrounding region to the mine site. This decision was made to limit the risk of transmission of the virus between separate regional populations and to maintain Syama's isolation from the virus," the company states. Resolute says it has informed the union that the strike notice is "irresponsible, opportunistic" and represents a breach of the commitments made in the Syama Workforce Stability Agreement. The ASX- and LSE-listed company is considering how to respond to the strike notice and intends to continue to seek the union's understanding and support for the appropriate actions, consistent with Malian labour laws, being taken to maintain the safety and sustainability of operations at Syama. Given the uncertainty of the impact of the strike and consequential actions that may be taken by the company on production at Syama, Resolute has withdrawn its production and cost guidance for the full year ending December 31.
