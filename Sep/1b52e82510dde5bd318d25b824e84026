LUSAKA – Zambia will remove import duty on copper ores and concentrates to encourage local processing, Finance Minister Bwalya Ng’andu said in a Budget speech delivered in Parliament on Friday. Africa's second largest copper producer saw its export earnings from the metal in the first half of the year fall 14.8% to $2.3-billion due to a drop in prices, he added.
