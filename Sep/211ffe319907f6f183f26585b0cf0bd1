Canada-based Yamana Gold expects to begin trading on the main market of the LSE before the release of its third-quarter results next month and says it is making good progress with exploration. In an update on Tuesday, the company listed its planned London market debut as a notable upcoming event and stated that its third-quarter results would be announced on October 29. Yamana announced its planned listing on the LSE main market in July, which it said would widen its shareholder base to include European investors. Besides Yamana, fellow Canadian miner Endeavour Mining is also weighing a secondary listing in London. Meanwhile, Yamana reported that exploration had yielded “promising” new discoveries for the company and that its commitment to near-mine exploration had resulted in significant new mineralised zones not currently in its life-of-mine plans. “Exploration results continue to support year-over-year growth, with promising new discoveries in the first half of 2020, indicating excellent potential for new mineral reserves and mineral resources at year-end,” the company reports in an exploration update for its Minera Florida and El Peñón mines, in Chile, and the Jacobina mine, in Brazil. An exploration update for Canadian Malartic would be announced early in the fourth quarter.
