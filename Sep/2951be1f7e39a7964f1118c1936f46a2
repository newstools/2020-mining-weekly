The Stibinite gold project, in Idaho, has received a ‘permitting dashboard’ to improve coordination, transparency and accountability to projects under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) permitting process. The dashboard comes at the request of the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), with the approval of the Secretary of Agriculture, in recognition of the project's status as a high-priority infrastructure project. Projects that have received a permitting dashboard are afforded enhanced coordination between federal agencies. "Given the complexity of permitting the redevelopment and restoration of an extensively impacted brownfield site, inter-agency cooperation and coordination is essential to ensure a comprehensive review of the project is completed in a timely manner," said Midas Gold Idaho president and CEO Laurel Sayer. The Stibnite permitting dashboard maintains the same permitting schedule as that published by the US Forest Service (USFS) in July, with a final record of decision in the third quarter of 2021. The USFS released a draft environmental impact statement for the Stibnite project on August 14, that was developed under longstanding NEPA rules and regulations; the recently updated NEPA rules announced by CEQ have not been applied to the project. Midas Gold is being sued by the Nez Perce Tribe, but the Canadian company contends that the water quality concerns stemmed from activities that occurred decades ago – before the company existed.
