Explorer Talisker Resources has received conditional approval to list its shares on the TSX. The company will delist its shares from the Canadian Securities Exchange. “This listing will further increase our investment appeal and broaden our shareholder base in line with our corporate growth strategy,” said president and CEO Terry Harbort. Talisker is exploring for gold in British Columbia. Its projects include the Bralorne project, an advanced stage project with significant exploration potential from an historical high-grade producing gold mine, as well as its Spences Bridge project where the company holds 85% of the emerging Spences Bridge Gold Belt and several other early stage greenfield projects.
