Rio Tinto Exploration Canada has completed its summer exploration programme at the Janice Lake Sedimentary copper/silver project in northern Saskatchewan. TSX-V-listed Forum Energy Metals reports that a total of 25 holes have been completed for 818 m on seven targets. Assay results are expected in four to six weeks. "Rio Tinto is compiling all of the data collected from this summer's programme for planning of a potential drill programme in 2021. Results from this summer's work are expected to help refine drill targets, including the 2.8-km-long Rafuse target, located 3 km north of Janice, which has seen limited historic drilling,‚Äù says Forum Energy president and CEO Rick Mazur. Further details are expected by the end of October. Construction of the on-site 80-person Burbidge Lake camp was completed and is now well positioned to serve as a base of operations for future exploration campaigns on the property.
