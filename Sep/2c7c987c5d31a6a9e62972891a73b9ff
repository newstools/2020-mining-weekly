TSX-V-listed Giyani Metals Corp has completed a processing trade-off study for its K.Hill manganese project, in Botswana, as part of the ongoing feasibility study. The results from the study, conducted by Tetra Tech, do not materially change the robust project economics outlined in the project’s preliminary economic assessment (PEA), as was announced in April, the company says. Tetra, together with engineering consultants Royal IHC, sought to identify the optimal processing route for the project. This study only focused on the reductant phase of the process, which occurs upstream of solvent extraction and electrowinning. The PEA assumed a sulphuric acid and reducing sugar-based process, but the study assessed two alternatives, in addition to the process outlined in the PEA. Giyani says the study showed that the sulphur dioxide-based process is the optimal route, as there is less process risk. The operating costs and capital associated with this route were also in line with those modelled in the PEA and, as a result, the sulphur dioxide process has been selected for the feasibility study. CEO Robert Birchall says the change in reductant process means the company has reduced its process risk, without any increase to capital or operating costs. “We are fortunate that our process is simple, thanks to the deposit’s grade, quality and proximity to the processing plant.”
