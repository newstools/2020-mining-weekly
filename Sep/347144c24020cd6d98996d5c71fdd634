Jan Steenkamp has resigned as MD of Aim-listed emerging phosphate miner Kropz's Elandsfontein project, in South Africa. He will, however, remain on the board of Kropz Elandsfontein as a nonexecutive director, as well as in a technical advisory capacity for the ongoing development of the Elandsfontein and Hinda phosphate projects. The Elandsfontein phosphate project is located in the Western Cape, while the Hinda project is located in Congo-Brazzaville. Steenkampâ€™s executive responsibilities will be taken over by Kropz COO Michelle Lawrence. Additionally, Kropz announced the appointment of Louis Swart as financial manager, effective October 1. Swart previously served as CFO at Richland Resources and as financial manager for TanzaniteOne. After various project delays over the last few years, owing to process plant modifications and a pending Water Tribunal appeal hearing, Kropz expects the project to start producing phosphate in the fourth quarter of next year.
