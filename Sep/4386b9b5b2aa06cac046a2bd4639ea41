Ontario gold miner Harte Gold on Thursday announced the appointment of former Detour Gold COO Frazer Bourchier as CEO with effect from September 21, succeeding Sam Coetzer, who is stepping down as president and CEO for personal reasons. The company also announced that COO Martin Raffield would step down, citing constraints on cross border travel owing to the pandemic. Raffield is a resident of the US. Sugar Zone mine GM, Dan Gagnon, has been appointed VP of operations. Coetzer would continue to serve on the board of Harte Gold, while Raffield would remain as a consultant to the company until the completion of the feasibility study for the Sugar Zone mine, in the fourth quarter. Bourchier is a registered professional engineer. He was most recently COO of Detour Gold and prior to that he was COO at Nevsun Resources.
