Aim-listed diamond miner BlueRock Diamonds has recovered a 9.7 ct diamond with an initial independent valuation estimate of $75 000. This marks the second high-value stone recovered at Kareevlei diamond mine, in Kimberley – BlueRock’s flagship operation − this quarter. Executive chairperson Mike Houston says the frequency of high-value stones is expected to continue and improve, which will “further underpin the potential of the Kareevlei mine”.
