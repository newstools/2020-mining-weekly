PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Aluminum producer Alcoa has inked three new gas sales and purchase agreements that would supply 198 PJ of gas to its alumina refineries in Western Australia, starting from 2024. The company this week said that the agreements with Warrego Energy, ExxonMobil and Chevron, coupled with existing gas contracts, would supply Alcoa’s three Western Australia refining operations over a ten-year period. “Reaching these agreements demonstrates our long-term commitment to our Western Australian operations and provides a positive outlook for our employees, suppliers, customers and the communities where we operate. “The addition of new market entrant, Warrego, to our gas supply portfolio continues our decades-long support of the Western Australian gas industry, which has underpinned the state’s economic prosperity since the 1980s,” Alcoa VP of operations in Australia, Michael Gollschewski said. “As the state’s largest domestic gas consumer, Alcoa has contributed to the development of the North West Shelf gas project and Dampier to Bunbury pipeline.” “Meanwhile, we are pleased to be working with two of the state’s longstanding gas suppliers, Chevron and ExxonMobil.” Starting in January 2024, Chevron will supply Alcoa with an additional 37 PJ of equity domestic gas over a multi-year term, further to an existing agreement signed by Chevron and Alcoa in December 2018 for the supply of 64 PJ of equity domestic gas. Chevron Australia MD Al Williams said the contract with Alcoa highlighted Chevron’s ongoing commitment to Western Australia. “We are pleased to continue our valued relationship with Alcoa, a significant employer and driver of economic activity in Western Australia. “As a leading domestic gas supplier, Chevron Australia is committed to delivering affordable, reliable and cleaner-burning energy to homes, businesses and industrial customers across the state.”
