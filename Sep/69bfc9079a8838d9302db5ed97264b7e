Aim-listed mineral resource company Keras Resources says it “looks forward” to continuing its work with the incoming Togo government, following the election in February this year. Togolese PM Komi Selom Klassou and his government have resigned and while this resignation was expected, it was delayed until now by the Covid-19 pandemic. The change in government is considered a procedural process and Keras’ directors do not expect it to impact on or undermine the progress being made at both Lomé and the Nayéga manganese project.
