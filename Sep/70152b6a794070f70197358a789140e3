PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Metals miner Independence Group has launched a strategic review into its 30% interest in the Tropicana gold joint venture (JV), in Western Australia.

The company said on Friday that the strategic review was launched after unsolicited approaches from a number of parties, and a desire to ensure the value of Independence’s interest in the JV was maximized. “Tropicana is clearly a high-quality and significant asset within the Independence portfolio, however, Independence’s strategic focus is on commodities that are critical to clean energy,” said MD and CEO Peter Bradford. “In the current gold price environment, we do not believe that Independence’s share price fully reflects the value of Tropicana. As such, in parallel to an assessment of future underground opportunities at Tropicana, Independence has commenced a review of its investment in Tropicana and how best to realise the asset’s full value to the benefit of shareholders.” The company has advised JV partner AngloGold Ashanti, which will collaborate with the review, of its intention. The review will be conducted over the next three to six months.
