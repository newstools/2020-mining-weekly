PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The Western Australian Department of Mines, Industry, Regulation and Safety has granted ASX-listed Strike Resources a mining lease for its Paulsens East iron-ore project. The mining lease will have an initial term of 21 years. “The granting of our mining lease is another key milestone for the company as we continue to make rapid progress in advancing the Paulsens East iron-ore project,” said Strike MD William Johnson. The mining lease follows on from the execution of a Native Title Agreement on August 14, and paves the way for Strike to lodge its mining proposal for formal approval to carry out mining operations. A previously completed scoping study for the Paulsens East project found that the project could produce some 1.5-million tonnes a year over a mine life of four years.
