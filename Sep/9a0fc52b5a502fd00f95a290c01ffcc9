Potash development company Kore Potash has started work on the first phase of a definitive feasibility study (DFS) for its 97%-owned DX Potash project in the Sintoukola basin of Congo-Brazzaville, following a recent equity fundraise. Phase 1 of the DFS is scheduled for completion in May 2021. A drilling programme consisting of the drilling and analysis of up to five new holes is planned to begin in October and is expected to improve confidence in the value of DX. The programme will be carried out using company-owned drill rigs. The mobilisation of the drilling crew has started, and drilling is due to start in October. A number of international consultants have been engaged to support the environmental and technical aspects of the DFS. Lithium and potassium producer SQM, one of Kore’s major shareholders, is providing technical support for key aspects of the DFS. “I am very pleased that work on the DX definitive feasibility study has commenced. This is another important milestone towards bringing the DX project into production as a low-cost potash producer at a time when demand for potash continues to grow. "The combination of DX’s high grade and low cost nature is truly unique and we look forward to continuing to move the project forward,” said Brad Sampson.
