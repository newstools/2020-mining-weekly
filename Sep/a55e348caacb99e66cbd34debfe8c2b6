PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Consolidated Zinc has secured offtake agreements for 100% of the zinc concentrate production expected from its Plomosas mine, in Mexico, for 2021. The company on Thursday reported that its subsidiary Minera Latin American Zinc had executed an extension of the zinc concentrate offtake agreement with Latin American mining company Industrias Penoles, providing certainty for all of the zinc concentrate produced at the Plamosas mine in 2021. Industrias Penoles is one of the world’s leading refiners of zinc and the largest global refiner of silver. Consolidated Zinc told shareholders that the company would increase zinc concentrate output at Plomosas through process plant modifications in order to reduce the amount of zinc metals which reports to the lead concentrate. This is expected to further improve the high quality lead concentrate delivered to market, which will reduce costs and increase the value of the lead concentrate by-product.
