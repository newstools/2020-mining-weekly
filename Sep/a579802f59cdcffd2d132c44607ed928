PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Lithium developer Core Lithium has flagged the potential sale of its noncore silver assets in the Northern Territory. The company on Thursday said that it had received a number of expressions of interest for its Blueys silver project, where drilling had previously intercepted grades of up to 1 000 g/t silver and 17% zinc and lead. “We are pleased to have received this interest in our noncore silver assets and will carefully consider the best course of action with a view to generating the maximum value out of these assets for our shareholders,” said Core MD Stephen Biggins. He noted that given the prospectivity of the silver assets, and in conjunction with the prevailing silver price, Core’s management team has been considering and exploring its options for the Blueys silver project, including an asset sale or restructuring the silver assets with a view to generate the best outcome for shareholders. The company remains of the view that there was significant potential to infill and expand the high-grade silver mineralisation in order to define a maiden Joint Ore Reserves Committee-compliant silver mineral resource. “As we have stated, we remain committed to progressing activities at our flagship Finniss lithium project, in the Northern Territory, which was recently the subject of a A$5-million concessional finance facility through the Northern Territory government’s Local Job Fund,” Biggins said.
