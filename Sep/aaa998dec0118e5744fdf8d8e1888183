PERTH (miningweekly.com) â€“ ASX-listed Jupiter Mines on Thursday said that production and exports from its Tshipi Borwa manganese mine, in South Africa, remained on track, despite the project tracking behind plan. The company told shareholders that overall mining volumes during the quarter ended August were below plan as a result of continued delays in mobilising additional equipment, due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The mine was also issued with a Section 54 notice by the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy relating to drilling and blasting activities, some pit haul roads, and mining of the barrier pillar. Despite the issues reported at the mine, Tshipi Borwa delivered 840 469 t of manganese during the quarter ended August, compared with the 694 769 t in the first quarter, with sales increasing from 321 733 t to 898 107 t in the same period. Sales revenue for the second quarter also increased from A$52.3-million to A$154.1-million, with earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization increasing from A$35.8-million to A$76.5-million.
