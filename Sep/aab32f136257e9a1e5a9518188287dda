Canada’s Canpotex, a joint venture between Mosaic and Nutrien, said on Wednesday that it was fully committed on volumes for potash sales for shipment through to December 31. The company said there was continued strong demand for potash in key offshore markets, supported by solid fundamentals for agricultural commodities in numerous growing regions. The focus on food security continued in a number of Canpotex’s offshore markets.
