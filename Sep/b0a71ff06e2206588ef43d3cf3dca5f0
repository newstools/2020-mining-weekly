Canada-based junior Group Eleven has started drilling at the Stonepark zinc project, in the Limerick basin of Ireland. Stonepark is a joint venture between Group Eleven and Irish explorer Arkle Resources, which trades in London. The drill programme at Stonepark will consist of two step-out holes, totalling about 810 m (360 m and 450 m, respectively). The holes will test extensions of the Stonepark mineral resource estimate, which currently totals 5.1-million tonnes, grading 8.7% zinc and 2.6% lead in the inferred category. Stonepark is about 1 km west of the Pallas Green zinc/lead deposit.
