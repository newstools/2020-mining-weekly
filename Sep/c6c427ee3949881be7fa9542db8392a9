PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The Carmichael coal mine, in Queensland, is on track to produce its first coal in 2021, with Indian major Adani revealing that employment numbers at the project have reached more than 1 500. Adani Mining CEO David Boshoff said the Covid-19 recession meant Adani’s investment was needed more than ever. “We are proud to have made good on our promises to Queensland, and especially regional Queensland. We’ve created more than 1 500 jobs and signed more than A$1.5-billion in contracts,” Boshoff said. “Mining has cushioned the Queensland and Western Australian economies from the worst of the devastating economic impact of the Covid-19 lockdowns and we are proud to be a part of that,” he said. “As we work with smaller, private, and Queensland-based contractors and suppliers we have been able to keep working through the Covid-19 pandemic with appropriate measures in place. “More than 88% of our contracts are being delivered in Queensland and have been spread across all corners of the state to give as many regions as possible the opportunity to benefit from our project, while also enabling us to tap into the highly-skilled construction and resources industry workforce that Queensland possesses,” he said. Boshoff said that more permanent roles will be forthcoming with the operation of the mine.
