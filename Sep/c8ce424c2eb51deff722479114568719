ASX-listed Resolute Mining’s subsidiary in Mali has managed to sign a conciliation agreement with a union representing workers at the company’s Syama gold mine in the country, which will prevent further strike action at the mine. Resolute’s subsidiary in the country, Société des Mines de Syama (Somisy) achieved a compromise with Union Nationale des Travaileurs du Mali (UNTM) under which a commission will be established to evaluate and support measures that Somisy believes are required in response to Covid-19 and prevailing economic conditions. UNTM agreed to be involved in identifying solutions and cancelled proposed strike action at Syama. However, Resolute says its gold production for the current quarter will nonetheless be impacted by the industrial relations dispute and strike action taken prior to the agreement. Resolute expects a loss in production of about 15 000 oz of gold for the quarter and adjusted its yearly guidance accordingly to between 400 000 oz and 430 000 oz.
