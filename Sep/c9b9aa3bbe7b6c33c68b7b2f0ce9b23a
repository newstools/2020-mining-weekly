Full tensor gravity gradiometry (FTG) data company Bell Geospace and the Botswana Geoscience Institute (BGI) have launched the Mineral Prospectivity Mapping project at the virtual Africa Mining Summit 2020, held on September 15 and 16. The project promotes access to integrated quality geoscience data which goes a long way in determining the success of operations in a region. The project, integrating FTG data – with airborne magnetic, electromagnetic, geochemistry and geological information – will automate a process of delineating and evaluating mineral prospectivity within an area of interest. Classification of the assessed area will be based on the mineral potential and the estimation of the proportion of the undiscovered economically recoverable resource. Bell Geospace conducts gravity gradiometry and is involved in the acquisition, processing and interpretation of high-quality airborne FTG data for exploration. BGI is involved in research in the field of geosciences, providing specialised geoscientific services and promoting the search for, and exploration of, any minerals in Botswana. The institute is a custodian of all geoscience data, information and advice in all matters of geoscience and geohazards in Botswana. BGI has entered into this partnership with Bell Geospace to support its mandate. Mining companies will be able to use the information to support investment decisions. Bell Geospace CEO John Macfarlane says now is the right time to bring the right people together with the right data. “We are looking forward to delivering a world-class project for Botswana and set a workflow and proficiency which will have relevance across Africa and beyond.”
