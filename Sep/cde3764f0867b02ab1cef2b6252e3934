London-listed Anglo Asian said on Monday that it was monitoring the situation in Azerbaijan, where a decades-long standoff over the Nagorno-Karabakh region has escalated with fierce fighting reported between Armenian and Azerbaijani forces. The gold, copper and silver producer said its office in Baku and operations at Gedabek continued to function as normal. Anglo Asian also noted that hostilities in the Nagorno-Karabakh region had never affected the mountainous Armenian border area near the company's mining and processing operations. Nagorno-Karabakh is internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan, but is run by ethnic Armenians. On Sunday, the heaviest clashes since 2016 erupted, prompting fears of an all-out war between two former Soviet republics. Shares in Anglo Asian traded 7% lower on Monday.
