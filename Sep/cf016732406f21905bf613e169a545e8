Canada-based B2Gold has successfully expanded the mill at the Fekola mine, in Mali, to 7.5-million tonnes a year, about one month ahead of the scheduled completion date of September 30. Four days after startup, a five-day mill performance test was conducted from August 26 to August 30. The results of the performance test exceeded design in throughput, gold recovery, grind and availability over the five-day period. The minor, outstanding construction work is expected to be completed by mid-September. B2Gold says the Fekola mine continues to operate unimpeded and no operational days have been lost owing to the recent political developments in Mali, or the Covid-19 pandemic. The company has maintained its consolidated production guidance at between 1-million and 1.05-million ounces of gold, while total consolidated cash operating costs are forecast to be between $415/oz and $455/oz and total consolidated all-in sustaining costs are forecast to be between $780/oz and $820/oz.
