London-listed Atalaya Mining has started the permitting process to develop a 50 MW solar plant at its Proyecto Riotinto copper mine mine, in Spain. Technical studies have indicated that, in addition to making a significant contribution to reduce carbon emissions, the solar project is economically viable and could potentially contribute to reducing Proyecto Riotinto's operating costs, Atalaya Mining has said. "We are pleased to be committing to this solar initiative which will be one of the largest projects of renewable self-consumption in the industry,” said CEO Alberto Lavandeira. During the permitting period, the company would evaluate the various financing options that were being proposed by industry players in Spain. Subject to completing the permitting process and securing financing, construction would start by mid-2021.
