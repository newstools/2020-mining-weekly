PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Mining major Rio Tinto has unveiled a historic collection of 62 diamonds, including six ‘hero’ diamonds for its 2020 Argyle pink diamonds tender. Rio said this week that the six ‘hero’ diamonds were selected for their unique beauty and named to ensure there is a permanent record of their contribution to the history of the world’s most important diamonds. The ‘hero’ pieces include the 2.24 ct Argyle Eternity, the 2.45 ct Argyle Ethereal, the 1.84 ct Argyle Sakura, and the 0.43 ct Argyle Emrys. Also included in the tender offering are 12 lots of carefully curated and never to be repeated  sets of miniature rare Argyle pink, red, blue and violet diamonds, weighing 13.90 ct in total, Rio said. Titled The Petite Suites, these diamonds have been collected over a five year period. Due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic the 2020 Argyle pink diamonds tender has been previewed virtually with exclusive invitees before viewings later in the year at the Argyle mine, in Perth and then travelling to Singapore and Antwerp. Bids close on December 2.
