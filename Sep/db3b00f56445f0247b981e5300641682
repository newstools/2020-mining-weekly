PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed EcoGraf has inked a two-year option agreement with the Western Australian government over a 6.7 ha site in the Kwinana-Rockingham Industrial Area. EcoGraf signed an option to lease on two of the lots in the industrial area, with plans to develop a graphite processing facility in two stages. The development is expected to start construction in mid 2021. Production capacity for Stage 1 of the proposed facility is 5 000 t/y of battery-grade spherical graphite, increasing to 20 000 t/y with the completion of Stage 2, with the processing plant expected to cost some $72-million and employ some 275 staff during construction. "This is an exciting facility that will create jobs in Rockingham and surrounding suburbs,” said Western Australia Premier Mark McGowan. "The allocation of this prime industrial land to EcoGraf supports the state government's Future Battery Industry Strategy, which aims to grow this emerging sector in Western Australia and transform it into a significant source of economic development, diversification, jobs and skills. "Importantly, this proposed multimillion-dollar investment comes just two months after the opening of Alloy Road unlocked new strategic industrial land. "This is another demonstration of the great work done by the Industrial Lands Authority to facilitate industry growth and investment in Western Australia." EcoGraf told shareholders that the development of the processing facility was part of the company’s vertically integrated graphite business positioned to support the global transition to clean energy and electric mobility.
