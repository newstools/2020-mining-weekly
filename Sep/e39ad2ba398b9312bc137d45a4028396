West Africa-focused gold miner Cora Gold has appointed Norman Bailie as exploration head, with immediate effect. Bailie succeeds Dr Jonathan Forster, who is retiring from this role but will continue to be retained as an adviser to the company.
 
He is an accredited chartered professional geologist and manager with 29 years’ experience in gold mining and exploration. He joins Cora from his most recent role as group exploration manager for LSE-listed gold miner Centamin. Bailie will direct resource discovery and growth, manage the geological modelling and mineral reserve estimation delivery, and contribute to the corporate development strategy. Nonexecutive chairperson Ed Bowie says the addition of Bailie to the Cora team “will be valuable as [the company] works towards [its] primary objective of further developing Sanankoro with both resource growth and completing a definitive feasibility study”.
