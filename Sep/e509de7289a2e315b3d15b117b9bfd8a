The World Gold Council (WGC) has appointed streaming company Wheaton Precious Metals president and CEO Randy Smallwood as its new chairperson. Smallwood is replacing former AngloGold Ashanti CEO Kelvin Dushnisky, who was appointed WGC chairperson in March. He recently stepped down as CEO of AngloGold. Commenting on his appointment, Smallwood said that he was looking forward to work with WGC CEO David Tait and the team to advance the work of the council and to deliver industry-leading standards that help set the bar. "I am honoured to represent the World Gold Council as its new chair, especially in these times when the importance of gold is becoming ever more apparent. There is no better industry body to advocate the case for gold than the World Gold Council, who has worked tirelessly to grow gold's recognition as an essential allocation within any investment portfolio, while at the same time nurturing the more traditional demand segments.” Since 2014, Wheaton has been a member of the WGC, which includes the world's leading gold mining companies. The council is the market development organisation for the gold industry. Its purpose is to stimulate and sustain demand for gold, provide industry leadership and be the global authority on the gold market.
