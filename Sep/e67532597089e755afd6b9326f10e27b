The military confrontation between Azerbaijan and Armenia in the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region has thus far hadÂ minimal impact on the Kapan mine, London-listed Chaarat Gold reported on Wednesday. The Kapan mine, which the company bought last year, is about 150 km from the Nagorno-Karabakh region. Chaarat said that it was continuously monitoring the situation and that it had business continuity plans in place to react quickly to any new developments. It was also monitoring supply chains on a daily basis. Nagorno-Karabakh is internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan, but is run by ethnic Armenians. On Sunday, the heaviest clashes since 2016 erupted, prompting fears of an all-out war between the two former Soviet republics. The government of Armenia declared martial law in the country.
