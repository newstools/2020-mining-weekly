Canadian junior Fission Uranium has promoted chief geologist Ross McElroy to the position of CEO, succeeding Devinder Randhawa, who is retiring from management and as chairperson of the board. In a statement announcing the management change, McElroy says the company’s Triple R uranium deposit, in Athabasca basin, is a “one-of-a-kind” deposit and that could help ease an upcoming global uranium supply deficit. McElroy is a professional geologist with over 30 years of experience in the mining industry. He is the winner of the PDAC 2014 Bill Dennis award for exploration success and the Northern Miner 'Mining Person of the Year 2013'. As president and chief geologist of Fission and its predecessor, he has overseen two major uranium deposit discoveries including the world-class Triple R deposit. Meanwhile, Fission has also strengthened the governance of its board with the appointment of Darian Yip as its independent chairperson. Yip has about 18 years of experience in the financial services industry and has been focused on the metals and mining sector for the past 13 years.
