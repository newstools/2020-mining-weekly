PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Mining has started at the Western Strandline mineral sands project, adjacent to the existing Tormin mining operations, in South Africa’s Western Cape. ASX-listed Mineral Commodities on Friday reported that conventional openpit mining has commenced, accessing mineralisation from near surface, with excavators and articulated dump trucks. The company told shareholders that as part of a phased development programme, the first pit, which is only 600 m south of the Tormin processing plant, would initially target near-surface and high-grade strand horizons, which will be hauled to the existing primary beach concentrator and tailings separation plant for primary crushing. The red aeolian and orange feldspathic sands would subsequently be processed after the installation of a thickener, which is planned for the end of the December quarter. “The commencement of mining represents another significant milestone in the rapid development of the Inland Strand. Mining has commenced within two months of receipt of the approvals to expand the mining and processing operations at Tormin,” said Mineral Commodities executive chairperson Mark Caruso. The Western Strandline deposit is estimated to host some 106-million tonnes of ore at 12.4% heavy minerals, with nearly 22% of this resource located within the mining right area.
