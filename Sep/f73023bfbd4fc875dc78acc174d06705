The Prospectors & Developers Association of Canada (PDAC) has announced that its yearly convention will be held entirely virtually in 2021 for the first time in its 89-year history. As the Covid-19 pandemic continues to affect travel and major gatherings, the decision to move forward with a virtual event offers a safe and innovative solution for the industry to access the opportunities provided by the traditional in-person convention in Toronto. “PDAC made the decision to go virtual after many months of analysis and careful consideration, and we are encouraged by the prospect of reaching an even greater number of international attendees who may not be able to attend our event in person,” says PDAC president Felix Lee. The PDAC is billed as the world's biggest convention of miners, taking visitors from around the world. The 2020 event was held in early March - a week before the coronavirus outbreak was declared a pandemic - but several people tested positive after attending the convention. PDAC says the lineup and registration details will be confirmed in coming weeks.
