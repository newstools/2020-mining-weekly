State-owned power utility Eskom says the conveyor belt that feeds coal into the Medupi generation units, which failed on the evening of September 9, has been repaired and is back in service. This has lowered the risk of load-shedding. However, while no load-shedding is planned for now, Eskom says its system remains constrained and vulnerable.
