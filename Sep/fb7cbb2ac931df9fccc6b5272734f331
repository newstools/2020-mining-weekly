Aim-listed IronRidge Resources has reported additional high-grade drilling results from the second phase of its drilling programme at the Zaranou gold project, in Côte d'Ivoire. The Zaranou area is along strike from significant operating gold mines including the five-million-ounce Chirano, 5.5-million-ounce Bibiani and 17-million-ounce Ahafo mines. Drilling result highlights from the targets include 6 m grading 9.08 g/t from 53 m; 2 m grading 20.43 g/t from 58 m; 4 m grading 6.13 g/t from 52 m; and 7 m grading 3.16 g/t from 1 m. IronRidge says the work on the project has confirmed mineralisation continuity over a 1.7 km strike at the Ehuasso main target, with mineralisation open to the south-west and at depth. The company plans to undertake a 50 000 m follow-up reverse circulation and aircore drilling programme, with two drill rigs active on site and a third rig planned to arrive within four weeks.
